Review,Rating
"As always, whenever there's a negative hype around a movie, my mindset is always, prove them wrong, give it a chance.

It's diabolical, honestly, I can't understand how so much money and so much time has gone into this, the final result is cringe worthy. It is an absolute shocker, I am stumped to find any positives.

It looks and feels so artificial, the sets, the animals, as for The Dwarves themselves, I have no words to express my feelings there.

The biggest catastrophe, not what I was expecting if I'm honest, the worst offender, Gal Gadot, she looks sensational, but her performance, she's going to scoop some unwanted awards it's fair to say.

What I wasn't expecting, was just how poor the costumes would look on screen, Snow White's just doesn't translate very well, the hairstyle, what were they thinking?

Disney, what on Earth have you done?

"Disney's latest live-action remake, Snow White (2025), is yet another attempt to cash in on nostalgia, but unfortunately, it falls flat in almost every regard. From lackluster performances to subpar CGI, this film struggles to capture the magic of the original classic.

Rachel Zegler: A Miscast Lead

Rachel Zegler, who takes on the iconic role of Snow White, delivers a performance that feels stiff and uninspired. While she undeniably has a strong singing voice, her acting lacks the warmth and charm that made the animated Snow White so beloved. Her line delivery often comes off as forced, and she struggles to bring emotional depth to the character. Instead of exuding the innocence and kindness associated with Snow White, her portrayal feels distant and, at times, even disengaged.

Weak CGI and Bland Visuals

For a film with Disney's budget, the CGI is shockingly subpar. The enchanted forest, which should have felt lush and immersive, looks artificial, and the CGI creatures lack the expressiveness and charm of their animated counterparts. The dwarfs-who have been controversially reimagined-look awkward and unnatural, making it hard to emotionally invest in their presence. The visual effects in Snow White feel rushed, and instead of enhancing the experience, they serve as a constant distraction.

Music: Strong Vocals, Forgettable Songs

If there's one aspect where the film slightly shines, it's Zegler's singing. She undeniably has a beautiful voice, and her vocal performances are solid. However, the new songs she's given are bland and unmemorable, failing to capture the whimsy and timeless appeal of the original soundtrack. Unlike Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid, which at least had a few standout musical moments, Snow White's soundtrack feels generic and uninspired.

Conclusion: A Missed Opportunity

Ultimately, Snow White is another soulless live-action remake that lacks the heart and magic of the original. While Zegler's singing is a bright spot, her acting, coupled with bad CGI and uninspired musical numbers, makes this adaptation feel unnecessary. Disney had an opportunity to bring a fresh and captivating take on Snow White, but instead, they delivered a forgettable and lackluster film. Fans of the original will likely leave disappointed, longing for the charm and artistry that made the 1937 classic a masterpiece.",1/10
"Saw this at the cinema with my six-year-old daughter. She laughed at a few scenes but whispered, ""this is boring"" about forty five minutes in. Watched the rest but we were both happy when the movie ended.

For me, the CGI was distractingly bad. I wasn't aware of the issues the film had with casting prior to the release but they should have either gone with actual actors or spent more money. It's worse than you think, and it's not just the dwarves, the forest and other scenes are poorly done.

A couple of the songs were catchy but by that point I just wanted the credits to roll. Acting wise, I guess the actors had to work with what they were given, but they seemed disconnected and going through the motions. Snow white's lines sounded forced and uncommitted. A better actor might have played the role more believably but again, she had to work with what she was given. I think though, the original film had an innocence this actress didn't grasp or was unable to portray.

Really, this movie seemed more like a 'direct to video' movie than a large budget Disney production. I've seen better CGI in small budget television shows and far better acting. Maybe miss this one unless your little ones really want to see it. Even then, maybe wait for it to be free on a streaming service. It's just not worth paying to see.",1/10
"Snow White remake set out to modernize the classic fairy tale, but it ultimately leaves audiences disappointed. The film fails to stay true to the original story while also struggling to establish its own identity.

First and foremost, the lifeless script is a major issue. The characters lack depth, the dialogues feel artificial, and there's no emotional connection with the audience. Key elements of the fairy tale have been altered, but rather than making the story more engaging, these changes strip it of its essence.

The performances aren't particularly impressive either. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks charisma and inspiration, making the character feel ordinary and at times even unlikable. Additionally, the characters replacing the seven dwarfs are weakly designed and serve no meaningful purpose in the story.

When it comes to visuals and production quality, the film is shockingly mediocre for a Disney production. The CGI looks cheap, backgrounds feel artificial, and instead of creating a magical atmosphere, the movie ends up looking dull and uninspired.

Ultimately, this film feels like Disney turning its back on its own legacy. It doesn't come across as a loving modernization of a beloved classic but rather a project driven by political correctness with little artistic vision. The result? A failed adaptation that neither satisfies old fans nor captivates new audiences.

Another remake where Disney continues to kill the magic of its classic animations...",1/10
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is yet another misguided attempt to modernize a classic, but instead of breathing new life into the beloved fairy tale, it strips away everything that made the original special. With uninspired performances, weak visuals, and forgettable music, this film serves as a prime example of why not every animated masterpiece needs a live-action remake.

Rachel Zegler: A Snow White Lacking Charm Casting Rachel Zegler as Snow White seemed like an interesting choice, but unfortunately, her performance falls flat. While her singing ability is undeniable, her acting lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the character. Instead of a sweet and kindhearted princess, this Snow White comes across as distant, and at times, even uninterested in the story unfolding around her. Her line delivery feels forced, and there's little emotional connection between her and the world she's supposed to inhabit.

Dull Visuals & Poor CGI Disney is known for its stunning animation and groundbreaking CGI, but Snow White (2025) somehow manages to look cheap and unpolished. The enchanted forest, which should have been lush and magical, looks like an over-processed video game backdrop. The CGI dwarfs, which already sparked controversy before release, look awkward and unnatural, making it even harder to connect with them emotionally. Rather than immersing the audience in a fantasy world, the visuals constantly pull you out of the experience.

Music: A Forgettable Soundtrack The one highlight of the film is Zegler's singing, but even that can't save the uninspired and generic new songs. Unlike Disney's previous live-action adaptations, which at least attempted to reimagine classic melodies, Snow White (2025) fails to create any memorable musical moments. The new songs lack the magic of Someday My Prince Will Come or Heigh-Ho, leaving nothing that audiences will hum after leaving the theater.

Conclusion: Another Failed Remake Snow White (2025) is a textbook example of how not to remake a beloved film. Instead of enhancing the story, it strips away its charm and replaces it with a lifeless, forgettable adaptation. Disney had the chance to create something special, but what we got instead is yet another uninspired cash grab that fails to justify its existence. Fans of the original will likely leave the theater disappointed and frustrated, once again questioning why Disney insists on remaking its animated classics when the magic clearly isn't there.

Final Verdict: 2/10 - A dull, unnecessary remake. Just rewatch the original.",2/10
"Putting aside of all the political controversy and discussions revolving around the film, if we focus this remake as itself, still, it is really unnecessary and quite dull.

Disney has continued to prove that live-action remakes of classic animated tales are getting tiresome and unoriginal. Besides The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon remake being pretty good, the other remakes have remained dull, baffling, or offensive. Snow White is one of those dull ones. Covered with excessive usages of CGI and colors, the camerawork, production style and colors feel bloated and unsocial. Alongside with the bland direction, uninteresting takes of how they tell the tale and where the characters were once beloved in the animated movie, becomes lifeless and uninteresting here. The choice of using CGI dwarfs really was a bad idea because it came off as quite uncanny and unintentionally creepy to observe at times.

The performances....aren't very great. Rachel Zegler does give her best as she does have solid moments including some of the voice performances from the other cast. Gal Gadot, however, her performance really didn't work at all. Gadot lacks the emotion and creep charm to what the Evil Queen should have been.

Despite some good looking designs on the backgrounds and all, it was really boring. Marc Webb tries his best but unfortunately, really little about this would ever work.

Please, audiences, stop giving the remakes money because they are just as responsible for the remakes to keep existing.",2/10
"This movie makes no sense. It is a complete disaster. My 5-year-old was so upset because the cartoons she watched did not look the same in the film. Disney did not work on the script, horrible actor selection and extremely poor CGI. This movie has everything wrong with modern cinema. The lead actress has no charisma and is not talented to work on classics like Snow White. The screenplay is poor and filibustering. I highly recommend not watching this movie, it is indeed a big disappointment. Disney needs to change its leadership and must remember who the core audience is. If the parents don't like it, then the kids don't like it either. 5 years old are not paying to watch ridiculous movies.",1/10
"This movie is perfect.

If you live out of your car and you're looking for a dark, temperature controlled theater with absolutely nobody else watching so you can get some sleep this a perfect film. The dullness and idiocy of this garbage film is great for putting you to sleep as well. It's also great having access to the theaters bathroom.

It's nice to know peace and just catch up on sleep. If it was a movie that was remotely interesting it would probably keep me up. The fact that nobody EVER comes to see Snow White ensures privacy for me which I've come to expect and I'm never let down. I'll miss Snow White when it leaves the theater which will probably happen soon because like I said nobody ever comes to see this film, like ever.",10/10
"Does this film really deserve the wave of criticism that has fallen on it? It's best to see for yourself, maybe not necessarily in the cinema, but it's worth giving it a chance and checking if this movie is really as bad as others say.

To begin with, a few positives. ""Snow White"" is an acting adaptation of the cult Disney animation from 1937. The plot itself has not undergone significant changes, although instead of the classic prince from the fairy tale we get Jonathan (Andrew Burnap) - a rebel who has to earn the feelings of Snow White. Thanks to this, their relationship is different from the original - we do not have love at first sight here, but a feeling built on emotions and events lived together.

The film also defends itself in terms of music. The songs, musical scenes and choreographies are well made, and the whole looks pleasant to both the eye and the ear. The humor is typically Disney - the dwarves provide a lot of funny moments that can amuse younger viewers (and even older ones).

Moving on to the negatives - the biggest problem is the acting. Rachel Zegler as Snow White sings great and is obviously trying, but her acting is more like a theatrical performance, which does not necessarily fit this film. Gal Gadot in the role of the Evil Queen is even worse - her performance is downright terrible, and singing makes things even worse. The special effects are at a decent level, but the dwarves are a big minus. Their appearance is a strange mix of animation and live action, which at least doesn't work for me at all.

To sum up - In my opinion, ""Snow White"" is a pretty good proposition for children who are unlikely to pay attention to imperfections - after all, it is a film aimed mainly at them. I myself had a good time at the screening, although I see its many flaws, it is certainly not as bad as the media say, but it is also far from being called very good. It is best to watch and evaluate for yourself, instead of being guided by other people's opinions :)",6/10
"The remake of Snow White is far from living up to its beloved origins. The film fails to capture the charm and magic of the original, and its modern reinterpretation leaves much to be desired. The acting performances are lackluster and unconvincing, with the cast struggling to truly inhabit their roles.

Similarly, the singing-a cornerstone of any classic Disney production-falls flat, delivering numbers that are both technically weak and emotionally uninspired.

This review is not about political correctness or the current trend of being ""woke."" Instead, it's about a missed opportunity to honor a timeless tale. Disney had the chance to recapture the nostalgic essence that made the original so cherished but instead opted for a misguided reinvention that erases much of the magic and wonder we once knew. The story, characters, and musical numbers suffer from a lack of creative vision, resulting in a product that is both disappointing and disheartening.

Ultimately, the Snow White remake is not worth the entry price, as it fails to evoke the emotional resonance and excitement that audiences expect from a Disney classic. It's a stark reminder that sometimes, in the pursuit of modernity, the heart of the story is lost in translation.",1/10
"To be fair, I have thought a lot of this movie and found the conclusion that Disney does neither understand the old animated movies nor the original fairy tales.

If you do a twisted fairy tale movie, okay all right, then use a different name, as was done with Frozen or Tangled or ""Mirror, Mirror"" and whatever. Of course, Disney movies are always different, but there is a high responsibility as they are regarded as cultural representation, and as a German, I really want to talk about this controversy. All right, if you need to change the back story of the name Snow White, why not simply introduce a real name. Dwarfs in fairy tales are of course not the same as people with dwarfism, and so the CGI idea with also introducing a human actor with dwarfism (with even a heroic task) could have worked, but removing simply the word dwarf does not help. How odd, as usually Disney is so careful of historical accuracy, there is silence about the obvious German connotations of both 1937 movie and the original tale. Although the love story with a guy called Jonathan is more contemporary elaborated than the insta-meet-cute with her prince, it can not evoke the same emotions as the 1937 movie. CGI animals are cute, but seriously? Snow was already in 1937 a leading lady and strong character, but Walt Disney decided to focus on a decision for love instead of power or ambition, so the political-moral connotations in this new movie are rather more backwarded than they actually are thinking. Although going the safe way with keeping definitely surprisingly many things intact from the 1937 movie, even with an old-fashioned fairy tale book opening and taking something from Cinderella live action - with amazing brightness and cheerfulness, it soon goes away from the old story into a world of reimagining. It makes me think of ""Mirror, Mirror"" with touch of the Disney Robin Hood and Tangled movies (and a bit of the German Simsala Grimm Schneewittchen version!), yet failing to showcase the kindness Snowy is constantly talking about. There could have made better use of the original tales (Brothers Grimm, but also tradition of Ludwig Bechstein, Johann Musäus and Ludwig Albert Grimm). Never much exploring the original characters, but somehow throwing in Jonathan's seven bandits as MIRRORED version to the dwarfs (these were the first version leaked, which turns out not to be the 7 ""dwarfs"",which is a good attempt to keep up a mirror structure of the main Disney couple), but so random named (Bingley?? Norwich??? Why???). Anyway, the music is charming, but reminds with ""let go, let glow"" too much of you know what I mean, also such like a reminiscence ""Waiting on a Miracle"" from Encanto. The spectacular musical scenes are very good, but a big contrast to the quiet cottage-core feeling of the 1937 movie In fact, it's a twisted remix, just like a rock/pop version of a music piece by Mozart. It might be worth as an idea offering enjoyable moments and tunes, but considering it as improvement is insane. Just like Enchanted was already a reimagining of Snow White, this is also another one and should be called in my opinion perhaps ""Mirrored"". An interesting advertisement campaign for the old movie and related products through reverse psychology. Particularly, too many mixed ideas. ""Strong independent"" - but princess -, still not as daring as in Mirror, Mirror, here in a child costume advertisement spot, and let's not forget that girl empowerment does not work this way with an anachronistic understanding of monarchy (Disney Queen franchise?), and let us simply dream, not be lessoned...",1/10
"Snow White, the original animated film, was incredibly popular and was responsible for a much needed morale boost during a dark time in the US and the globe.

The remake is not a credit to the original, in many ways it makes a mockery of the original, taking the beloved character and shifting her entirely into someone else.

The music was halfhearted and the dwarves felt like an afterthought, the plot doesn't really involve them beyond their presence, you can tell that many retakes occurred and that fact should be invisible to the audience.

Do better Disney, this was a shame and I cannot determine for the life of me, why Disney would do this.",1/10
"I attended the Snow White remake last Thursday with high hopes, only to find myself marooned in a sea of kitsch, cheap effects, and an utterly barren vision.

Marc Webb's direction could generously be described as a masterclass in mediocrity-an exercise in how not to reimagine a classic. His handling of the material was so devoid of creativity that even the most outlandish camp would have been an improvement.

The so-called seven dwarfs? They weren't authentic actors at all; instead, we were treated to a parade of CGI caricatures that failed to capture any semblance of charm. Their forced musical numbers were as out-of-place as a kazoo in a symphony-an entirely misguided attempt at infusing musical flair that only underscored the film's overall discordance.

Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White was painfully bland, with a performance that vacillated between uninspired and downright wooden. And then there's Gal Gadot as the evil queen-her performance, marred by a haughty arrogance, was as unconvincing as it was theatrically misguided. The chemistry, or lack thereof, among the cast only amplified the film's deficiencies.

Every element-from the poor acting to the mismatched musical attempts-conspired to create an experience that was both artistically bankrupt and humorously tragic. It's astonishing how a project can simultaneously squander a beloved tale and insult the audience's intelligence.

Save your time, money, and sanity; this film is a stark reminder that not every retelling deserves a second chance.

A truly deplorable, negative experience in every sense.",1/10
"If you ever wondered how a timeless fairy tale could be transmogrified into a cinematic trainwreck, ""Snow White (2025)"" answers that question in the most excruciatingly painful way possible. This live-action disaster-directed by Marc Webb-manages to twist a magical classic into a hollow parody that insults its own source material.

From the first frame to the final cringe-worthy scene, nothing about this film feels authentic or magical. Rachel Zegler's Snow White, instead of exuding grace or wonder, stumbles through a muddled script that seems more intent on pandering to modern gimmicks than honoring a beloved tale. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, though a familiar face, appears trapped in an identity crisis that renders her both over-the-top and underwhelming. The production's relentless overuse of flashy effects and forced modern sensibilities transforms what should have been a timeless narrative into a disjointed mess-an exercise in creative misdirection that leaves audiences wondering if the director was aiming for satire or if he was simply out of ideas.

The film doesn't just miss the mark-it shatters it into a million unwatchable pieces. It's an utter waste of time and talent, a cinematic abomination that makes you question why any remake was even attempted. Simply put, ""Snow White (2025)"" is a parody of its own potential, a laughable, lifeless rehash that deserves nothing more than a 1/10.

Do yourself a favor: skip this trainwreck.",1/10
"To all the naysayers: you all must be miserable human beings. The music was good. The CGI dwarfs were cute annnnnnd the animals. They gave the movie the Disney appeal so I don't understand what the fuss is about. I don't think the movie would've worked with actual little people as the dwarfs. I will say, Gal Gadot as the evil stepmother wasn't convincing & she can't sing but she looked good but I didn't care for her as Wonder Woman either. Snow White is worth the watch and my 11 year old and I enjoyed it and the kiddies are the only one's who need to enjoy it..............................................",9/10
"I honestly had no issue watching this movie. At first I skeptical with all drama from the actresses pre-release, but it wasn't bad at all. The musical was pretty good actually. Yes, Snow White's acting could be better, but it wasn't awful. I like that the love theme stayed in the movie and wasn't just about a strong woman leader. My biggest complaint is that they used CGI for the dwarves. I understand why though (to maintain their familiarity with the original) but using real dwarfs would of been better. It was quite disturbing that there was a real dwarf in the movie...but it was 1 of the bandits. Overall, id recommend seeing the moving and not believing all the negativity.",7/10

"The apple was the least poisoned thing on screen. The dwarves acted like grumpy old men, not miners, just muttering and shuffling around. The prince was boring as hell, no spark, no nothing, like he slept through the whole movie. The story wandered around with no point, like it got lost in the woods. The forest looked fake and the whole thing felt like a school play gone wrong. You'd think with all that money, they'd make something decent, but no, they churned out this snooze fest instead. Skip it unless you hate yourself or love watching paint dry. A fairy tale so dead, no kiss could save it.",1/10
"The original was made almost 90 years ago and sadly you'd think that period of time would mean significant improvements in the ability to make a good movie while there's lots of shiny CGI it just doesn't gel. Disney seem to be on a roll, they bought the Star Wars & Marvel franchises a few years ago and those have been on a steady decline ever since. Unfortunately, the only thing this live action remake looks set to beat is the very low IMDB rating of the 2022 Pinocchio live action remake which has a rating of just 5/10, even with the star power of Tom Hanks, Snow White is sitting at 2 at the moment. The live action version of Mulan also bombed at the box office, Peter Pan & Wendy 2023 (with an IMDB of just 4.4) was also pretty dire. It seems there's also a live action version of Bambi in the works which doesn't bode well.",1/10
"As a grizzled movie critic with a nose for trash, I'm here to declare the new *Snow White* a cinematic catastrophe so abysmal it makes the dwarves' coal-dusted day job seem like a vacation in paradise-Grumpy's perpetual frown is the only thing more warranted than my outright revulsion. The plot lurches along like Sleepy after a three-day bender, tripping over itself in a haze of incoherence, while the CGI is so heinously bad it looks like Dopey was handed the reins to the animation software and told to ""figure it out."" I'd sooner volunteer to scrub the Evil Queen's dungeon floors-or stare at drying paint in her torture chamber-than endure this soulless, cash-grabbing travesty again; mirror, mirror on the wall, this remake's the most wretched of them all!",1/10
"Disney DNA was originality, innovative artistry, emotional storytelling, attention to detail, timeless appeal and a sense of wonder. These remakes all fail on every aspect.

Originality: (It's a remake after all)


Innovative artistry: There is no innovative tech, or anything that pushes movie making forward.








Sense of wonder: No imagination, you don't feel like you are exploring something you haven't seen before, it doesn't spark that childlike curiosity and awe about things that aren't real, but could be plausible.

Disney DNA died in the 90s. Ever since then they have been culturally and creatively bankrupt, and only survived thanks to all the acquisitions of far more creative and imaginative studios which they gradually are turning to trash.

The original snow white is still remembered almost a century later whereas the new one will be forgotten a year from now.

When people have to choose which one to watch, people will say ""let's watch the good one"" without specifying what the good one is, and yet everyone will instantly know what the good one is; the animated one.",2/10
"One of the worst live-action remakes ever made. The story is poorly rewritten, the pacing drags, and the visuals feel lifeless. Gal Gadot's performance as the Queen is stiff, lacking menace and presence. The dwarfs feel irrelevant, and their inclusion is pointless. Iconic moments are either removed or handled so badly that they lose impact. The CGI is disappointing, and the entire film lacks the charm or magic expected from such a remake. Instead of a respectful update, it feels like a soulless cash grab. A frustrating, unnecessary remake that fails on every level. 1/10.

If you care for your hard earned money dont waste it one this movie.",1/10
"Disney's live-action Snow White aims to reimagine a timeless fairy tale, yet it falters dramatically due to Gal Gadot's uninspired portrayal of the Evil Queen. Gadot's performance is marked by an overdone, mechanical display of villainy-her exaggerated eyebrow arch and flat vocal delivery fail to capture any real menace or seductive complexity. One respected critic from DiscussingFilm even claimed this might be Gadot's worst performance to date. Rather than delivering a multifaceted, memorable antagonist, Gadot's Queen comes off as a poorly conceived caricature that drains the film of dramatic tension. While Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White offers warmth and charm, Gadot's lackluster approach undermines the film's overall impact, leaving viewers with a forgettable and disappointing villain who fails to justify her role in this modern retelling.",1/10
"Talk about people jumping on a bandwagon.... I hadn't seen any reviews, took my 2 children on opening day. We walked in with open minds and it was a great film.

Snow White is my favourite Disney Princess, mostly the imagery, the colours etc.

There was never really much story to the original film so not much to go on.

I thought this remake was lovely, gentle story, great costumes, animation of little men (which she refers to as, in original film) was fun and the mine song, trolley ride was really sweet and got me. Kids loved it, songs were well done and sung beautifully.

People take everything so seriously these days, this is a fun, easy watchable, enjoyable film that most with an open mind and open gentle heart will enjoy.",9/10
"This movie does not deserve the hate it is getting. I definitely recommend giving it a watch. Snow White was a fun movie for the entire family. It stayed true to the original and was beautifully done. Rachel Ziegler was a true talent and Gal Gadot delivers a good performance as the evil queen. Dwarves were fun. Costumes on the evil queen were outstanding. Set design was beautiful. The cgi on the animals is the best Disney has done in a long time. As a whole the movie was good, Could it have been better, of course. But as a whole it was a cute movie and I think you should definitely give it a watch.",7/10
"The 2025 remake of Snow White is, quite frankly, a disaster in every sense. What was once a timeless fairy tale full of heart and wonder has been stripped down to a dull, lifeless spectacle with none of the charm or magic that made the original so beloved.

The acting is flat and uninspired, with performances that feel forced and emotionally disconnected. The lead actress, in particular, struggles to bring any real presence or depth to the iconic role of Snow White, leaving the character feeling hollow and unrelatable.

Visually, the film fares no better. The animation and effects are shockingly subpar - at times reminiscent of outdated video game graphics. Rather than enchanting the audience, the film bombards them with artificial visuals that lack any real artistic vision.

But perhaps the greatest failure lies in the story itself. The narrative is scattered, lifeless, and entirely devoid of emotional resonance. Gone is the heart of the original tale, replaced by a rushed, soulless plot that seems more interested in ticking boxes than telling a meaningful story.

This adaptation doesn't honour the classic nor does it offer a compelling modern take. It's a missed opportunity - a hollow, joyless retelling that fails to leave any lasting impression.",1/10
"Just watched Snow White and yeah, I wasn't a fan. I went in curious to see how they'd reimagine the classic, but it kind of missed the mark for me. First off, it didn't feel like Snow White at all. They tried really hard to make it modern and ""different,"" but in doing that, they stripped away everything that made the original story charming and magical. It felt more like they were pushing a message than telling a fairy tale. Not saying stories can't evolve, but this one felt forced.

Rachel Zegler's version of Snow White wasn't relatable or likeable. She came off a bit self-important instead of kind and warm like the Snow White we all know. And where are the dwarfs? They swapped them out for random magical creatures, and it just didn't have the same fun vibe. Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen was probably the best part-she had some great moments-but even she couldn't save it.

Visually, it was okay. Some scenes looked cool, but overall it was super CGI-heavy and kind of flat. The songs? Pretty forgettable, honestly. Nothing I'd go back and listen to. Overall, it felt like they tried so hard to make a statement that they forgot to make a good movie. If you loved the original Snow White or were hoping for a fun fantasy film, I'd probably skip this one.",1/10
"This movie was not worth my time or money. It's an odd take on a classic and was honestly completely unnecessary. I don't mind that Rachel isn't white as snow, even though that was kind of Snow Whites whole thing, but the other choices throughout the movie that were questionable and just, frankly, terrible made the move unbearable.

I don't understand the CGI choices. There are plenty of actors who could have played the Dwarfs. It made it weird that they were CGI and I didn't connect with them at all.

Rachel's acting was decent, but most of the rest were terrible. Gal Gadot being the worst. The overacted and it just came off as cheesy and stale instead of a fresh take on the evil queen. Though I suppose when it comes to casting someone as evil, they picked the right actress. If only she could act her way out of a bag. Being pretty only gets you so far, Gal.",1/10
"Where do I even begin? The plot was so convoluted and nonsensical, it felt like the writers threw darts at a board of random ideas and called it a script. Scenes dragged on unnecessarily, making an already incomprehensible story feel like an eternity. I spent most of the movie wondering when it would finally end, and not in a suspenseful way. Avoid this at all costs unless you're looking for a cure for insomnia.

The acting in this film was atrocious. It felt like they pulled people off the street and gave them lines to read without any direction. The characters were flat, unlikable, and made decisions that defied all logic.",1/10
"A Catastrophe of Epic Proportions - A Career-Low for Everyone Involved

Where do I even begin? This movie is not just bad-it's a cinematic trainwreck that should be studied in film schools as a cautionary tale. Every aspect of this film, from the acting to the script to the direction, feels like a masterclass in how not to make a movie.

Let's start with Gal Gadot. Her line delivery is wooden, her expressions range from mildly confused to completely indifferent, and any attempt at emotion falls flat.

The script is an absolute disaster-full of nonsensical dialogue, forced exposition, and laughable attempts at drama. It's as if the writers Googled how to write a screenplay and then actively ignored every good piece of advice. The pacing is absolutely torturous. Scenes drag on for what feels like hours, yet nothing of importance happens. It's both boring and exhausting, which is a rare and unfortunate combination.

And then there's the direction. The action, if you can call it that, is a jittery mess, with rapid cuts that make even the simplest sequences unwatchable. The cinematography is uninspired, and the tone is all over the place-at times trying to be serious, then suddenly switching to unintentional comedy.

The final nail in the coffin is the sheer lack of originality. Every trope, every cliché, every overused plot device is thrown into the mix with no attempt at innovation. It's as if this movie was made by an AI trained exclusively on the worst action scripts ever written.

Simply put, this film is an insult to audiences. It's not just a bad movie-it's an unwatchable disaster. Save your time, your money, and your sanity. Avoid at all costs.

One star, and only because IMDB won't let me give zero.",1/10

"The only real good thing I have to say about the movie was with some of the songs and Ziegler and Gadot have the chops to sing them well. Otherwise, this movie falls into the same trap that other previous iterations have done which was they all strayed from the original plot line. It certainly didn't help that some of the Production and effects felt obviously rushed. These main factors makes me not want to recommend this movie to anyone. If you want to watch Snow White, I would recommend saving your money and watch the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarves on DVD, Blu Ray or Video Cassette if you're old school.",2/10
"I came into this movie with very low expectations but nothing could have prepared me for just how bad it actually is.

The story has nothing to do with Snow White at all. They basically just took the name Snow White and made a completely different and much much worse story. I'm using the term ""story"" very loosely because there isn't really any story here.

The acting is also terrible, in particular Rachel Zegler's performance is just awful and extremely bland and uninspired.

I can't really think of a single positive about this movie, it's just awful from start to finish. I can't imagine what the Disney execs thought was going to happen with this movie, but I'm assuming that someone will be fired over this mess.",-/10
The costumes acting and attention to detail and storytelling were usual Disney top notch. The story was so nice with a great message. Classic songs were great to hear. I loved the way Snow White was adjusted slightly to make it a little more current but remain true to the Snow White story. The costumes were exceptional. Both Snow White and the witch really acted so well. The seven drawfs added just the right amount of comedic relief and attention to the story. The ending was a wonderful message to the audience. I would definitely recommend this movie. Glad I took the opportunity to go see it for myself.,8/10

"Watching Snow White (2025) felt like staring at a distorted reflection in the Magic Mirror. The attempt to modernize this timeless tale was a misguided endeavor that stripped away its charm and magic, leaving a hollow shell. Rachel Zegler's portrayal was unconvincing; instead of embodying the warmth and kindness of Snow White, her character felt distant and forced, reciting lines that lacked authenticity. The CGI creatures replaced the dwarfs, but their lifeless presence couldn't rekindle the magic of the original. Visually, the enchanted forest was more plastic than fantastical, and Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, while stunning, lacked any real menace. Every element-from the scattered narrative to the soulless musical numbers-felt rushed and uninspired. The 'modern audience' Disney aimed for was always an illusion; this retelling fails to find its heart or its purpose. A poisoned apple indeed.",1/10
"This film is an absolute failure on every level, completely lacking the magic, charm, and heart that made the original story so beloved. From the very beginning, it feels uninspired, with flat performances, dull dialogue, and a lifeless atmosphere that fails to create any real emotional connection. The pacing is inconsistent, dragging in places where it should be engaging, making the entire experience feel like a chore to sit through. Visually, it fails to impress despite its massive budget, relying on inconsistent CGI and uninspired production design that lacks creativity. The film tries to be something new but ends up feeling forced and soulless, as if it was made with no real passion or understanding of what makes a great fantasy movie. It lacks excitement, depth, and entertainment value, making it one of the most forgettable and disappointing films in recent memory. Audiences deserve better than this lazy, uninspired mess that does nothing to justify its existence.",1/10
"I remember when I was 6 a bought Snow White to watch it on DVD, it was my favorite movie, it's like a core memory to me. I grow up watching this movie every weekend.

Now after watching the live action i'm more than disappointed.

BAD ACTING especially Gal Gadot, her acting looks like a movie parody, it was hard to watch her on this movie. Rachel Zagler i'm not saying she's not talented she has an amazing voice but this role was not for her, she is not Snow White and this role didn't fit her at all.

Was it necessary to change the original story?

Why didn't Disney make another movie but decided to destroy our favorite movie trying to do something interesting??",1/10

"This is just another Disney gamble that did not pay off. The difference, though, is that this abysmal film cost a quarter of a billion dollars.

That's right. $250,000,000.00.

And with that chunk of change, you get a low-rent cast that shouldn't be portraying the characters that they have been given, and CGI that reminds you that real dwarfs are necessary if one is to remake a live-action film about Snow White.

You can't really blame Disney on their decision to go through with the film, though. Even with the warning from the general public, they had already invested enough money into the project that they went ahead with it, hoping to get some return on their investment and a write off on their losses when tax time came around.

Of course, no one could predict the buffoonery of Rachel Zegler.

As we all know, Zegler was a PR nightmare. This needs to be address, even if it is a film review, since Zegler's personality carries onto the film itself.

Gal Gadot does not help matters either, since she plays the evil queen with the same vigor as a high school student. Frankly, it seems that she has never fully recover from the blunt reality check that her ""Imagine"" video gave.

The film itself is uninspiring. Sure, the visuals have been updated since the animated feature from 1937, but it does nothing for the story. In fact, the updated visuals take away from the innocence of the story, since every thing looks completely fake. Snow White does not look beautiful and innocent, but resembles a stock player at a parade event. The Evil Queen is not frightening, but instead almost looks comical. Cassandra Peterson would have done a better job as the Evil Queen.

Rachel Zegler gives an uninspiring performance as Snow White. She can sing, this cannot be argued, but her acting chops resemble a high school performance. At least Gal Gadot attempts to act, be it overacting. What is a bit humorous was with all the proclamations by Zegler that this ""Snow White"" was not a love story (by a ""stalker"") by a story of a woman empowered to be the leader that she is destined to be, the audience ultimately finds out that it is just a hollowed-out remake of the love story. In this film, Snow White is cared for by the Seven CGIs, and when she is put into her apple-coma, she is brought back to live by her love interest (who happens to be a thief, and not a prince....go figure). It is hypocrisy at its finest.

As far as the music is concerned, all songs sound nice, but they all are forgettable. You will not be humming ""Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, its off to work we go"".

The CGI little ones are nightmare fuel, and the rest of the CGI effect (like the forest animals) look just as bad. There is nothing cute to look at. I can honestly see young children being frighten by these dwarfs. I can imagine CGI Dopey looking up at some kid and saying, ""Oh, yes. They float.... They float....and when you're down here with me.... YOU'LL FLOAT TOO!""

I saw this film mistake with my niece and nephew. I knew it was not going to be a pleasant two hours, and Disney did not disappoint. When my niece and nephew saw ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (1971), for days they sang ""I've got a Golden Ticket...."". After seeing ""Snow White"", they went back to playing on their Xbox. Now that is as honest as a critique can be.

If you want your kids to see ""Snow White"", rent or buy the animated 1937 film. The innocence is still there, and perhaps your kids will learn that if you are good, then good things will happen to you. Perhaps a naive concept, but you have to give children all the hope you can.

""Snow White"" (2025) does not give anyone any hope. It just shows that ugly people can pretend to be nice people, but they are still ugly.",1/10
Took my two daughters to see this. Went in with an open mind. It was sadly absolutely dreadful. The lead actress has no charisma. The script is poor. It's repetitive. All gloss and no substance. It has no soul. No heart. Badly cast. My daughters became restless and clearly weren't enjoying what they were seeing. Where was the magic ? It's everything that's wrong with modern movies. Why make the changes they made ? What is wrong with the original story ? Someone has to stand up and say to movie moguls that the emperor has no clothes. Stop ruining everything we held dear and do something fresh and original.,-/10
"Its a nodern remake, love that disney is keeping up with the diversity in the world. People cling too much to the original and do not see the importance of a little modernization.

The dark forest was a little to much, in my opinion, it gave me a little Alice in wonderland vibes. Didn't have a lot of added value. Would have loved a little more of the storyline about the witch and the ways that she tried to kill Snow White.

But overall, an amazing production. It showed a good storyline and showed al the important thing out of the original fairytail.

Really loved the taks on the Dwarfs and the bandits in the Forest.",9/10
"7.5/10 Snow White is sweet, at least mostly, though not without its flaws, while i acknowledge both the good and the bad, i find myself enjoying the good more, Disney's classic tale is reimagined with a lovely performance by Rachel Zegler, who carries the film effortlessly, the musical numbers are delightful, except for Gal Gadot's part, which leaves something to be desired, the representation of the seven dwarfs is well done, and overall, the film serves as a serviceable modern reimagining, the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a landmark in cinema history, beloved for its simplicity and timeless charm, the 2025 adaptation was a pretty good expands upon the classic while maintaining its enchanting essence, though not perfect, it brings a fresh perspective to the tale of the fairest one of all, and i can definitely see myself revisiting this version and enjoying it once again.",7/10
"The film is a major disappointment, lacking authenticity and emotional depth. The interpretation of the original story feels soulless, and the execution falls flat. While Rachel is a talented actress, she is miscast as Snow White, failing to capture the essence of the character. Gal Gadot, despite her star power, also feels out of place, and the role puts her in an awkward position where she cannot fully shine. The overall production feels artificial, with uninspired performances and a lack of genuine charm. Unfortunately, this adaptation is a waste of money and fails to do justice to the beloved classic.",1/10
"Honestly, it feels like they took a beautiful classic and completely stripped away the charm and heart that made it special in the first place. The changes don't add anything meaningful, and instead of feeling fresh or modern, it just comes off as awkward and forced. The characters feel flat, the story lacks emotion, and the overall vibe is more like a hollow remake than a tribute to the original. If you loved the original or even just appreciate a good story well told, this one might just ruin it for you. Save your time (and money) and rewatch the classic instead-at least that one still has magic.",1/10
"This movie was horrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Get it together, Disney. I am baffled by how a corporation like Disney manages to screw up a classic.

It is clear that if Disney continues to go against the original concept, it will be an epic failure. Stick to the original. It is a classic for a reason. There was no need to revamp anything. I do not understand the need or desire to change things.

I hope Disney learns its lesson. The same example can be said of the Little Mermaid. At this point, leave the classics alone and stick to writting new fairy tales.

My children will never see this movie!",1/10
"Disney's 2025 Snow White isn't just a misstep-it's a full-blown tumble down a creative cliff. In a clumsy attempt to ""modernize"" the classic, the film strips away the magic, charm, and heart that made the original a timeless masterpiece.

Rachel Zegler's performance, while technically competent, feels emotionally disconnected. Her Snow White comes off less like a dreamer and more like someone begrudgingly enduring a role she doesn't believe in. It's hard to root for a character who seems to roll her eyes at the very story she's part of.

The dwarfs-sorry, the ""mystical forest dwellers""-are barely distinguishable, both in personality and purpose. What was once a band of lovable, quirky companions is now a generic group of background extras with less chemistry than a high school science lab.

And then there's the writing. Bland, preachy, and painfully self-aware, the script is so focused on making statements that it forgets to tell a story. The dialogue feels like it was churned out by a committee more interested in Twitter applause than timeless storytelling.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. Sure, there are some beautiful shots, but they're buried under flat CGI environments that feel more like a theme park ride than an enchanted forest.

Ultimately, this Snow White is less a reimagining and more a joyless rebranding. In its eagerness to prove it's not ""that old fairy tale,"" it forgets to be a fairy tale at all.

To all the bots who thought this was a ""wonderful"" movie, nice try.

Only the Evil Queen had the right idea: tear it all down and start over.",1/10
"After seeing all the controversy over this movie it peeked my interest to see it even more. Decided to give it a shot with an open mind. All in all I can honestly say that was a big mistake. The movies was so cringe worthy I couldn't even sit through the whole movie. I decided to leave before the middle so I couldn't tell you much after the beginning really wish they would give refunds because out my 35 years I've never had to walk out the theater until I saw this disaster. Disappointed in Disney, hopefully in the future they will listen to their consumers and avoid failures like this in the near future.",1/10
"Or else there's no way I would've paid for ten family members to see this. It's just... bad. Singing is a 6.5/10. Some good, some bad. ""Acting""is 3/10. And this Ziegler person? No thanks. If I never see her again, it will still be too soon. And, COME ON! You're telling me that the Step Mother (Gal Gadot) is supposedly jealous of how this Snow White looks??! Well, that's a 0/10 for reasoning. Come on.

My question to Disney is: If you didn't like the original movie and you don't like the people who come to see your movies, why did you even make this? Just save the 270 mil and we all could've stayed home.",1/10
"If I could give it a ZERO, that would still be too high. I had no love for any of the characters and almost walked out...and I wish I would have. It is not worth seeing. Rachel Zelger has a decent voice but the songs didn't make me go ""wow"". The dwarves weren't cute, they were a little creepy, it was hard to enjoy. For a live action, there wasn't much that was live action. The SGI was too much, it was practically a cartoon. The ending left a lot to be desired. It would have been best to end with Snow Whites death and be done with it.

Most movies leave me in tears wanting more. However this live action creation left me wondering when it will finally end.

This was a disgrace to the 1937 original and Disney should have scrapped this live action years ago.",-/10
"I watched Snow White in Spanish while visiting Mexico, and honestly, I went in expecting something bad because of all the negative comments online - but I was genuinely surprised. The movie had real emotion, great visuals, and a message that actually touched me. There was one moment near the end that even brought tears to my eyes. It caught me off guard in the best way.

I've seen movies that were way worse and got less criticism. This film doesn't deserve all the hate it's been getting. I felt the story had heart, and I connected with the characters more than I expected. The Spanish dubbing was solid and might've made a difference in how it landed emotionally - but I'm definitely going to watch it again in English with my nieces.

It's not a perfect movie, but it has meaning, warmth, and more soul than people give it credit for. Don't judge it based on internet noise - give it a fair shot and form your own opinion.",8/10
"""Snow White"" was a huge letdown. The story felt stale, with little effort to modernize or add depth to the characters. Snow White herself was bland and lacked any real development. The visuals were decent, but couldn't make up for the weak script and awkward pacing. The dwarfs were forgettable, and the villain was cartoonish without being compelling. It felt like a cash-grab rather than a sincere attempt to retell a classic. Even the musical numbers felt forced and uninspired. Disney clearly went down the wrong path-losing the heart, charm, and magic that once defined their timeless fairy tales.",1/10
"Without spoilers: The movie is poorly cast and has weak character design for nearly all characters. It's not to say any actor(s) in particular are bad at acting, no, its that certain ones were honestly just bad choices because they do not fit the character they were playing. Additionally, very amateur costume design and makeup accross the board, especially for the main character. They could have made a much more beautiful dress while keeping it like the original and given her much better hair and makeup. It looked cheap, like a costume, as did other characters outfits. CGI is subpar and certain characters that should play a bigger role, per the original, are rather ignored altogether and given little in regards to dialog. Not to mention the terrible messaging to the, what should be, target audience. Overall disrespectful to the original, badly written dialog, bad flow, plot is a joke with many problems... I could go on.

I fully understand that remakes, especially live action, will inevitably have differences from their original. However, certain changes are not only unnecessary but they are disrespectful to the original and make changes that end up fudging the entire story altogether. If your going to change such a significant amount of a story and their characters and so on, make a new story. Don't ruin something millions of people enjoyed as it already was.",1/10
"Where do I even begin with the disaster that is the new Snow White movie? Watching it felt less like enjoying a cinematic fairytale and more like enduring a painfully long lecture on how not to adapt a classic. This remake somehow manages to strip away everything that made the original magical and replaces it with a hollow, tone-deaf mess filled with arrogance and incompetence.

Let's talk about the cast - or rather, the lack of any meaningful performances. The lead is woefully miscast, coming across as smug and detached from the character she's supposed to embody. There's an off-putting air of superiority that clashes with the humility and warmth you'd expect from Snow White. Instead of charm and sincerity, we get wooden line delivery and expressions that range from disinterest to condescension. The supporting cast isn't much better, with performances that feel like rushed table reads rather than crafted characters. It's as if the film was more focused on checking boxes than telling a story.

Visually, the film tries hard to be edgy and ""modern,"" but it ends up looking like a low-effort cosplay production. The special effects are inconsistent, and the costume design swings wildly between uninspired and downright bizarre. The original story's timeless themes of kindness, courage, and love are replaced with forced messaging that feels less empowering and more preachy.

In the end, this Snow White is an unfortunate example of how studios can butcher a beloved tale by losing sight of what made it resonate in the first place. It's not progressive, it's not inspiring, and it's certainly not entertaining. If this is the future of fairy tale adaptations, count me out.",1/10
"Disney's latest attempt to reimagine a beloved classic, Snow White (2025), is nothing short of a catastrophe. Stripping away the heart and soul that made the original a timeless masterpiece, this misguided remake fails to add anything meaningful to the legacy of Walt Disney's work. One can only imagine Walt Disney rolling in his grave at the sight of this soulless adaptation.

Rachel Zegler, portraying Snow White, delivers a performance that lacks warmth and charm-traits that are quintessential to the character. Her portrayal feels distant, disinterested, and forced, with her line delivery devoid of genuine emotion. As a result, the emotional connection between the audience and the protagonist is completely absent, making it hard to root for or even care about Snow White's journey.

The visuals, however, are the sole bright spot in this otherwise dismal production. The efforts of the VFX and CGI teams shine through, demonstrating remarkable skill and attention to detail. It's evident that this aspect of the film received genuine care and hard work from the VFX team, but unfortunately, it cannot carry the weight of an uninspired story and lackluster performances. I do think it would have been better if humans played the dwarves though, since there's a lot of them wanting work in Hollywood.

The soundtrack is equally disappointing, with new songs that fail to capture even a shred of the magic and memorable melodies of the original. Bland, forgettable, and uninspired, the music feels more like a filler than a vital component of the storytelling experience.

One of the most glaring flaws in Snow White (2025) lies in its complete disregard for the original story that made the classic an enduring piece of cinematic history. The charm and simplicity of the original fairy tale have been traded for a heavy-handed attempt to modernize the narrative, resulting in a story that feels disconnected and devoid of the timeless magic that Walt Disney so carefully crafted. What made Snow White a beloved tale for generations was its sincerity, innocence, and universal themes, all of which seem to have been discarded in favor of a hollow, surface-level reinterpretation.

Rather than paying homage to the original characters and their arcs, the new story feels like an attempt to reinvent them in ways that are jarring and unfaithful to the source material. This shift not only alienates fans of the original but also undermines the very essence of what made Snow White's journey resonate so deeply. It's as if the creators prioritized ticking boxes for modern trends over respecting the rich legacy of the original fairy tale.

The performances exacerbate the issue further, as it seems the actors themselves lack respect or understanding for the characters they are portraying. Snow White, a character known for her warmth, kindness, and unwavering optimism, is portrayed with a level of detachment that feels entirely out of place in a fairytale setting. The attempt to inject a new personality into the character comes across as disingenuous, further driving a wedge between the audience and the story.

In many moments, it feels as if the actors are trying to reshape their characters into something unrecognizable, rather than embracing the spirit of the roles they were entrusted with. This disconnect contributes to a sense that the cast and creators view the original material not as a treasured classic to build upon, but as an outdated relic to be replaced. The result is a story and set of performances that fail to capture the heart and whimsy of the fairy tale world.

By disregarding the foundational elements of Snow White, the 2025 remake betrays its source material and its audience. What should have been a celebration of one of Walt Disney's most iconic creations instead feels like a disjointed, half-hearted experiment that strips the tale of its soul. Fans who cherished the original for its timeless simplicity and heartfelt storytelling will find themselves deeply disappointed by this hollow rendition.

In conclusion, Snow White (2025) feels like a cash grab-a lifeless, unnecessary remake that tarnishes the legacy of its predecessor. Fans of the original will undoubtedly find themselves disappointed and questioning Disney's continued reliance on rehashing classic works. If Walt Disney were here to see this, he would undoubtedly be embarrassed by the state of his cherished studio. I'll be showing my kids the original and I suggest that you do the same.",-/10
"I loved it, loved the original and loved this almost even more. Gal Gadot's acting falls kind of flat after the first two scenes she has but she's not in it TOO MUCH at least. Her song was...okay and her transformation scene made me laugh. BUT OTHERWISE, I really loved Rachel and Andrew's performances, their chemistry was great and the songs were fun! I think it's probably Disney's BEST live-action yet.

The dwarves to me weren't freaky (But I can understand why people think they are), and her dress looked much better when it was moving compared to when we just saw still photos of it. Snow White starts off timid and she has to basically find her voice once more, and Jonathan is a great addition (he reminds me a lot of Dimitri in Anastasia so like 10/10 for me lol) it was fun and I really do recommend it!",8/10

"I don't even know where to begin with this utter disaster. From the first frame to the last, this movie is an insult to anyone who values cinema. The plot is a nonsensical jumble of ideas that not only fail to make sense but also seem completely random. It's as if the writers threw every trope into a blender, hoping that something would stick. Spoiler: Nothing does.

The acting was atrocious-if you can even call it that. The lead actor looked like they'd rather be anywhere else, delivering every line with the energy of a wet cardboard box. It was like watching someone who had no interest in the role try to read a script they barely understood. The supporting cast? Even worse. Their performances were so bad I was genuinely embarrassed for them. If this was a high school drama club production, I'd still be appalled.

The dialogue is so cringe-worthy that I almost wanted to walk out of the theater. The characters spoke like they were reading off a sheet of paper, with no chemistry or emotion between them. Any attempt at humor fell completely flat, and every ""dramatic"" moment was laughably contrived. It was as if the filmmakers thought slapping together some words would somehow create a compelling story.

Visually, it's a nightmare. The special effects are so poorly done that they look like they came from a low-budget student film. The cinematography was as uninspired as it gets-every shot felt lazy, like they were in a rush to get it over with. Not a single scene felt well thought out or purposeful. And the soundtrack? Forgettable, uninspired, and completely out of place.

The pacing was a torture. This film was way too long for the amount of nothing it offered. Scenes dragged on endlessly, and I found myself begging for it to end. By the time the credits finally rolled, I felt like I had just wasted hours of my life.

This movie is a crime against cinema. It's not just bad-it's a miserable, painful experience that will leave you regretting every second you spent watching it. Please, do yourself a favor: avoid this at all costs. It's an embarrassment to everyone involved, and I'm convinced it's only getting any attention because of some marketing magic.",1/10
"We kind of knew what kind of a movie this would be thanks to re-shoots and delays after delays but my God this movie sucked. The only good thing in the movie was Zegler's singing. Apart from that, they even didn't properly utilized Gatos' assets as in, why was she fully clothed top to bottom? Was she impersonating the GIMP? They changed the ""fairest of them all"" to inner beauty and assigned that title to character named ""the evil queen"". Are you serious bro? In addition, it is super clear where the reshoots are attached together as you can clearly see which sets were added afterwards in CGI and which were the original sets without the CGI. Basically, even the CGI bits suck. C'mon Disney. Get your house in order!",1/10
"Fell asleep half way trough. What a bad actress. The dwarves where hilariously bad.

If you told ai to make Snow White dwarves look realistic I think it would look better than what they are now, it's crazy to me they didn't just go with DnD looking dwarves, it would've been easy.

I went into this with an open mind, but this is probably the worst live-action Disney remake so far.

250 million and then this monstrosity.

The singing is ok but not great. The writing is so bad, and Gal Gadot is not Convincing and overacting. To conclude, I would even stream this at home. Let alone go pay for a ticket.",1/10
"This movie is a soulless, joyless remake that completely misses the charm and magic of the original. The lead performance lacks emotional depth, and the script feels like it was written by a committee afraid of fun.

The film's disjointed narrative, weak character development, and bland visuals strip away the magic of the classic tale. Clumsy dialogue and an incoherent plot render this adaptation a dreadful spectacle, void of charm or innovation.

"Disastrous on so many levels... Starting with lead miscasting, through Gal Gadot's ""acting"", this soulless and unnecessary remake of a classic tale made me watch original snow white cartoon from 1937 the same night just to wash away the unhealthy feeling which the movie left me with. Very bad movie with actors repirising their roles dont have any idea about characters they are portraying and how should those characters be and feel.

"Really sloppy and greenscreen reliant. I dont appreciate that kind of movie making nowadays but that is basically what it has come to, the whole film industry for the past 10 years. They discovered green screens and have been abusing it more than ever and for more than just a scene, there are whole movies based entirely off of greenscreens!!! It is like - make it quick and make it cheap. There is a reason why movie golems such as Lord of The Rings and Harry Potter did so well and let me assure you no one in those productions wanted to make the movies easy and cheap.

"Took the family too watch it tonight. My 6 year old loved it so did the 12 year old, it's just simple Disney. I enjoyed it and didn't drift off so that's praise from me. I thought the cgi dwarfs were funny but I think Disney couldn't win whatever they did as far as that argument went. I did sit there waiting for some kind of battle or non comic fight but then remembered I'm here for my little girl. The songs were nice and hi ho hi ho will be stuck in my head all weekend. It's a kids film for little girls to learn that being brave and they can be hero's it's what Disney is for why over think it..",9/10
What a terrible remake of an iconic movie. Why why why Disney?? Gal Gadot looks great but should've known better to jump on board for this with Zeigler. Terrible portrayal of the iconic Snow White. I was reluctant to go see this movie but i wanted to give it a chance despite all the drama surrounding it. I was hopeful and left feeling very disappointed. Disney needs to learn these iconic movies are important to all new generations to keep its history. Disney has become a shell of itself and everything from its movies to its amusement parks has gone downhill the last 4-5 years. When will they learn?,1/10
"I'll start off saying something positive about Snow White: I liked the costumes, which captured the essence of Disney magic. That being said, this movie is yet another disappointing live-action remake in a growing list of unnecessary Disney reimaginings. The main problem here is the cast. Neither Rachel Zegler, nor Gal Gadot, nor Andrew Burnap can act very well. Plus, there are far too many songs, and I can't remember how any of them go. Also, Zegler sings like she's pining for a Tony Award, which is the wrong choice for this performance. Snow White is another bad apple in an already spoiled bunch.",4/10
"As someone who appreciates both classic Disney films and fresh reimaginings, I went into Snow White (2025) with an open mind. Unfortunately, what I got was a bland, uninspired adaptation that lacks the charm, heart, and magic of the original.

The biggest issue is the writing. The film strips away the fairy-tale wonder and replaces it with generic, uninspired storytelling. The dialogue feels forced, the emotional beats fall flat, and the pacing drags. Instead of enhancing the story, the changes to the original plot feel unnecessary, as if the filmmakers were trying too hard to make a statement rather than tell a good story.

The casting is another letdown. While there was potential, the performances feel wooden and lack chemistry. Snow White, a character who should embody kindness and wonder, comes across as oddly lifeless, and the supporting cast doesn't fare much better. The reimagined seven companions, in particular, feel out of place and lack the personality that made the dwarfs so memorable.

Visually, the movie has moments of beauty, but it's inconsistent. Some CGI-heavy sequences look rushed and artificial, breaking the immersion. The costume and set design, while ambitious, don't always fit the tone of the story, making it feel more like a generic fantasy film than a distinct Snow White adaptation.

Perhaps most disappointing is the lack of a strong musical presence. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is beloved in large part due to its iconic songs, but the new film's soundtrack is forgettable. Any attempts to modernize the music fall flat, making it feel soulless rather than enchanting.

Overall, Snow White (2025) is a missed opportunity. It fails to capture the magic of the classic while offering nothing compelling in return. Instead of a fresh and exciting reimagining, we're left with a hollow, uninspired film that will likely be forgotten soon after the credits roll. Disney has done far better with its live-action adaptations in the past-this one is a step in the wrong direction.",1/10
"What even was this?! Hoping for a fun movie night with the family, and was highly disappointed: Sub par acting from the cast, the story line veered so far off from the original, that it lost us. I was nodding off at some points, and highly annoyed when I wasn't falling asleep. Rachel is a great vocalist, this could have been a success, but she and the other cast members just didn't perform well. The storyline wasn't coherent. It was a hodgepodge of ideas that didn't land.

My kids were not into it at all, they prefer the original one far more than the train wreck that was. I owe them a good movie now.",1/10
Like I had so much hope for this amazing opportunity of remaking the classic snow white movie story. Like I understand to want to change but come on why change the custom and the stroy and really where is the song that we know in love. So no I hate it. I am sad they miss this amazing opportunity. I am also sad that they ruined one of my favorite movie. I wish they will stick to the stroy line and the original clothes style and yes change is good but noooo not a lot. Also I don't know what else to say but they movie is sad and terrible that they should do a remake remake of this movie. Hopefully.,1/10
"I went into the new Snow White movie hoping for a fresh, modern take on the beloved classic. What I got instead was a lifeless, uninspired mess that completely misses the charm and magic of the original.

First off, the writing is abysmal. The dialogue feels forced, the attempts at humor fall flat, and the changes to the story feel more like an agenda-pushing checklist than an organic adaptation. Snow White herself is completely devoid of personality, and rather than being a kind and courageous heroine, she comes across as smug and unlikable. The Evil Queen, who should be a scene-stealing villain, is reduced to a generic, one-dimensional antagonist.

The visuals don't help either. Despite a massive budget, the CGI looks cheap, the cinematography is dull, and the costumes are uninspired. Even the dwarves-if you can call them that-are completely forgettable. Whatever sense of wonder and whimsy Disney once had is long gone here.

But perhaps the worst part is how soulless the whole thing feels. Rather than honoring the timeless story that has captivated audiences for generations, this version seems embarrassed by its own source material. The filmmakers clearly wanted to ""fix"" Snow White, but in doing so, they drained it of everything that made it special.

Disney has been churning out unnecessary live-action remakes for years, but this one might be the most disappointing yet. If you love the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, do yourself a favor-skip this disaster and rewatch the classic instead.",1/10
"I went into this with an open mind, but despite my best efforts, I could not enjoy this ""film"". It was so sad to see such an amazing animated film ruined by such a poor modernization attempt. They should have just made a new Disney flick. The storyline was forced and focused on the wrong things, CGI was terrible Better casting could have helped as well, as the acting is just bad. Don't waste your money or your time. I hope Disney steps it up in the future. Live-action Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast paid great tribute to their originals while giving modern twists. Snow white fails miserably.",-/10
"It's honestly quite eye-rolling how people have ganged up on this movie. It's clear they have nothing better to do than to try to bring people down. I'd hate to live my life like that. Especially considering this movie turns out to be one of the most innocent features to come out in a while.

I went into Snow White without any devoted dedication to the original. For the first ever full-length animated feature, it has some good expressions, refreshingly organic animation, good colours and decent slapstick. It's also kind of slow-paced in my opinion, and I find it more enchanting as a piece of history than something I'll want to revisit. This movie on the other hand...

I knew they were trying a few new things with this one, and I was more interested in what those would be than honouring the original. And I have to say this new but still familiar take on the classic story was a feast on the eyes and especially the ears.

This is more of a Frozen-style musical, which is a hit-or-miss genre for me, but turns out, the songs, especially the new songs, are delightful. There are a few times where I felt they could've shaved off one or two, or not paused before the end. But every song was toe-tapping, and got better the more they went along. My favourites had to be Waiting on a Wish, Good Things Grow, and Hand Meets A Hand. I'm generally not a fan of musicals with too much music, because sometimes I feel there are moments that are better spoken than sung. This is no exception. But every moment where I felt that, I have to admit, the song was still decent. They don't get rid of the songs from the original, but the completely new songs were my favourites.

The dwarfs were a bit off-putting at first, but that's primarily because I'm so used to seeing them in cartoon form after all these years, whether from the original movie or in promos. But the truth is, if they were more similar to their original designs, they probably would've seemed plastic. And as the movie went on, I got used to them. Dopey took a fair minute, but I grew to like each of their designs.

And Rachel Zegler is incredible. I became a fan of hers after The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and I knew from that film she was going to be an amazing Snow White and she did not disappoint. Her singing, her soul, her completely natural and sincere performance...she's always been an amazing actress, and since this is her most popular project yet, I hope people really see it for what it is and give her the praise she deserves.

Snow White's two main messages are simple; united we stand, divided we fall. And rulers who hoard wealth and create division are evil. Oh, and that a bit of kindness goes a long way. Sometimes it's very on-the-nose. And it could've gone further in those messages. But in the end...those things are there, and they are the truth. What this movie is is a simple display of these messages, but in a world where we're encouraged to hate one another so much, it's nice to see a movie proud to promote inclusivity and togetherness, and how those values make you a true leader for the people. Kids will enjoy the messages, but adults may be reminded of how these things they were probably taught when they were kids...maybe they need a reminder of them? Like To Kill A Mockingbird, the movie reminds us that sometimes adults forget themselves and lose their innocence. And maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing to try and reclaim it.

This live-action remake honours the original that started animation as we know it, and extends the world with a more involving story, some new terrific songs, and a superb lead actress carrying it all. It's not perfect but it's honourable. Like the 2007 Hairspray, I finished the movie with my feet tapping. I'm looking forward to watching it again.

A-",8/10
"Recently just saw this new Disney live action remake with my friend last night.

Let me start out with the positives first

Number 1. Rachel Zelger was an amazing singer and extremely talented. And she did her absolute best of carrying the whole entire film

Number 2. I was extremely proud of her for building a strong chemistry towards the 7 cgi dwarfs.

Number 3. I love the way the dwarfs act towards one another.

Number 4. It definitely has a strong meaning to this live Disney remake

My only one complaint is Gal playing the main villain. It should've been given to someone else. That will give it there all.",7/10
"I genuinely don't know where to begin with this film. Maybe by saying this: it's a tragedy. Not the good Shakespearean kind either-just a full-on disaster. As someone who grew up loving the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, I walked into this remake hoping for even a spark of that old Disney magic. Instead, I walked out confused, disappointed, and a little bit angry. This movie is the exact opposite of what Snow White is supposed to be.

Let's talk about the casting, because I think it's the core of the problem. Snow White is supposed to be this radiant, kind, innocent girl who lights up the forest with her goodness and charm. The actress in this version? Not even close. I'm not trying to be mean, but she had none of the softness or warmth you expect from Snow White. Her performance felt stiff, robotic even, and honestly... she seemed more annoyed than enchanted by anything around her. Where's the wonder? Where's the sweetness? There was nothing graceful or inspiring about her, and that's heartbreaking because Snow White is supposed to inspire.

And don't even get me started on the seven dwarfs. Or should I say... the ""weird background group of people who kind of live in the woods and are just there."" They completely stripped the dwarfs of their individual personalities. In the original, each dwarf was unique-Grumpy was grumpy, Dopey was adorable, Doc was wise. That's what made them memorable. But in this remake, they're like an awkward side quest no one wants to click on. They felt like they were just thrown into the movie out of obligation.

Visually? Meh. The colors were muted, the forest didn't look magical-it looked like someone tried to film Lord of the Rings on a budget in their backyard. There was no enchantment. The original had charm dripping out of every frame-those little forest animals helping Snow White, the cozy little cottage, the sparkle of the wishing well. This version tried to be ""modern"" and ""gritty"" or whatever, but in the process, it lost its soul.

And then there's the writing. It felt like someone who didn't even like fairy tales wrote this script. Snow White didn't grow as a character-she just existed, said a few snarky lines, and that was it. There was no heart. No real lesson. And honestly, no real love either. The Prince (if you can even call him that) was barely in the film and felt like an afterthought. The romantic element, which in the original added such emotional depth, was completely gone. I get that times have changed and stories evolve, but changing everything doesn't make it better. Especially when you replace charm with attitude and wonder with bland empowerment slogans.

Disney had the perfect opportunity here. They could have remastered the 1937 version, added a few visual tweaks, maybe even extended a few scenes. That would've been worth watching. That would've made people cry with nostalgia. Instead, they delivered a half-baked modern mess that disrespects its own legacy.",1/10
"When I picture Snow White, a 14-year-old German princess with a fair and kind heart, I never envisioned a grown adult woman with a grating southwestern Valley Girl affectation. This thing might be Disney's biggest blunder in history, and I don't say that lightly. ""The Black Cauldron"" developed a passionate cult following. ""Home On the Range"" had some good soundtracks and Steve Buscemi. Disney's new remake of their 1930s animated classic just has absolutely no redeeming quality whatsoever, from this new pauper boy character shoehorned in awkwardly to attempt to appease angry fans of the original, to the offensively hideous CGI and derivative musical numbers where Rachel Zegler belches out her hopes and woes and dreams while staring up awkwardly into random space.

The cinematography is bad and aesthetic designs rely far too much on muted colours and digital padding to try and flesh out this rather dreary scenery into something more vibrant and alive. The costumes look absolutely foolish with the exception of Gal Gadot's. I know people keep on holding out hope for Disney, but we're all adults here, and we grew up. We have kids now who want to see new movies. Disney failed to grow up with us, and a new generation of children wants their 90s Disney Renaissance, but let's be honest here - they're not magical. Snow White is the result of nostalgia commodified, the byproduct of a multinational corporation that has given up on caring or never really cared at all. There's not even anything of value added to the story to make it fresh and new, they just took the original animated version's story and inbred it with a tired old warrior princess uprising resistance thing that ""Maleficent"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"" have already used. You couldn't even pay me to watch this again, but on the bright side it might finally wake Disney up to the fact that they can't just coast by on nostalgic properties and overpriced theme parks anymore.",1/10
"Just watched the new Snow White movie and... yikes. It's less fairytale, more fever dream. Gal Gadot plays the Evil Queen who's jealous of Snow White. GAL. GADOT. Jealous. Of someone who looks like she skipped out of a high school drama club and straight into a leading role. The magic mirror should've just said, ""You're literally Gal Gadot. Why are we even having this conversation?"" Snow White isn't looking for love anymore-she's staging a one-woman revolution. Every line sounds like she's two seconds away from unionizing the forest creatures. Meanwhile, Prince Charming shows up looking confused, like he wandered in from a different movie... and honestly? By the end, I kinda felt bad for the guy. He just wanted to be part of a love story, not get ghosted while the plot went full manifesto. And the dwarfs? Sorry, ""magical forest people."" They look like Lord of the Rings misfits who got kicked out of Middle-earth and had to settle for a bargain bin CGI. Which, by the way, looks like it was last updated when dial-up internet was still a thing. By the end, I wasn't rooting for anyone except maybe the poison apple. At least it stuck to the original plot. Disney, blink twice if you're being held hostage by bad focus groups.",1/10
"This remake of the cherished classic is, without a doubt, one of the most disappointing adaptations we've encountered in recent times. While the original tale of Snow White is a beloved story, endearing to both children and adults alike, this version seems heavily skewed towards an adult audience, but not in a favorable manner. It appears to be aimed at adults who harbor a desire to denigrate the original narrative rather than honor it. The essence of the original story, which captivated audiences with its charm and moral lessons, is utterly lost in this iteration. Disney, a studio renowned for crafting magical and timeless tales, seems to have missed the mark significantly with this production. The decision to produce such a film appears baffling, as it lacks the enchantment and whimsy that fans of the original would expect. Instead of evoking nostalgia and admiration, it leaves a sour taste, standing as an affront to the legacy of Snow White. The characters are poorly developed, the plot lacks coherence, and the visual aesthetics fail to capture the ethereal beauty synonymous with its predecessor. Overall, this rendition seems less like a homage and more like a misguided attempt that strays far from what made the original a masterpiece. It's a shame that Disney, with its vast resources and creative expertise, would choose to release a movie that feels more like a parody than a respectful reimagining of such a treasured story.",1/10
"I went into Snow White (2025) with an open mind, determined to ignore the negative hype and give Disney a chance to prove the doubters wrong. What a colossal mistake that was. This movie isn't just bad-it's a diabolical, cringe-inducing catastrophe that makes you wonder how a studio with this much money and history could churn out such an embarrassing pile of garbage. I'm genuinely stumped trying to find a single redeeming quality in this soulless cash grab.

Let's start with the visuals. The sets look like they were ripped from a low-budget video game, the CGI animals are laughably fake, and don't even get me started on the dwarfs. Whatever Disney was trying to pull with them-reimagined or not-it's an abomination. They're awkward, unnatural, and so poorly rendered I felt secondhand embarrassment for everyone involved. The enchanted forest? More like an over-filtered green screen nightmare. This is supposed to be Disney magic? It's a cheap, artificial mess that yanks you out of the story every five seconds.

Then there's Rachel Zegler as Snow White. Look, her singing voice is fine-great, even-but that's where the compliments end. Her acting is a disaster: stiff, forced, and completely devoid of the warmth or innocence that made Snow White iconic. She sleepwalks through the role like she's bored, delivering lines with all the charisma of a cardboard cutout. This isn't a sweet, kindhearted princess-it's a disinterested robot in a poorly styled wig. Speaking of which, what were they thinking with that hairstyle? And the costumes? They look like they were thrown together from a thrift store clearance bin. Snow White's outfit doesn't translate to live-action-it's a garish eyesore that screams ""we stopped trying."" But the real kicker? Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. She looks stunning, sure, but her performance is so atrocious she's practically guaranteed to sweep the Razzies. It's like she's auditioning for a parody instead of taking the role seriously. Every line she delivers is over-the-top in the worst way possible, making the character more laughable than menacing. She's the biggest catastrophe here, hands down.

Now, about the music. Zegler can sing, no doubt, but the new songs are so bland and generic, they might as well be elevator music. There's not a single tune that sticks with you or evokes any emotion. Compared to the timeless classics like ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" or ""Heigh-Ho,"" these new numbers are forgettable noise. Disney, what were you thinking? You had the chance to create something magical, and instead, you gave us this?

In conclusion, Snow White (2025) is a masterclass in how not to remake a classic. It's a lifeless, charm-less adaptation that strips away everything that made the original special. Disney, you've outdone yourself in all the wrong ways. This isn't just a bad movie-it's an insult to the legacy of Snow White and the audience's intelligence. Save your money and rewatch the 1937 original instead. Trust me, your time and sanity will thank you.",1/10
"Let's just cut to the chase-this movie is trash. I don't know what Disney was thinking, but this remake is an insult to the classic Snow White and honestly, to anyone who values good storytelling, acting, or just basic entertainment.

First off, Rachel Zegler as Snow White? Huge mistake. Her performance feels forced, awkward, and honestly, it seems like she doesn't even want to be there. There's no charm, no warmth-just an overwhelming sense that she's reading off a script and waiting for the check to clear. And Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen? Yeah, she looks great, but her performance is so over-the-top it's almost cartoonish. She's not menacing-she's just cringe.

And let's talk about the visuals-Disney had a massive budget, and somehow, this movie still looks like it was shot on a green screen with the cheapest CGI imaginable. The dwarfs? Oh wait-there are no dwarfs. Instead, we get a bunch of random, forgettable side characters that add nothing to the story. It's like Disney went out of their way to make sure nothing about this film resembles what people actually liked about Snow White.

The music? Completely unmemorable. You won't be humming any of these new songs because they sound like they were written by AI on a bad day. Meanwhile, they stripped away the iconic songs from the original because, I don't know, Disney just hates joy now?

And let's not forget the story-it's a mess. They tried to ""modernize"" the plot by making Snow White some kind of girlboss warrior princess who doesn't need a prince, but it's so forced and hollow that it just makes the movie boring. It's not empowering, it's just bad writing.

Overall, this movie is a soulless cash grab that no one asked for. It's not fun, it's not magical, and it certainly doesn't justify its existence. Disney needs to stop with these live-action remakes and actually focus on making new, original films instead of ruining their classics.

Rating: 1/10-Don't waste your time.",1/10
"Okay, so I just watched the 2025 Snow White movie, and honestly, it was such a letdown. The story felt all over the place-like they tried to shove in some trendy updates, but it just didn't fit with the vibe of the original, and I was left scratching my head half the time. Rachel Zegler as Snow White? She's more annoying than lovable, and don't get me started on those creepy CGI dwarves that looked like they belonged in a video game, not a fairy tale.

The whole thing was way too flashy, with these bright colors and effects that just screamed ""look at me!"" instead of telling a good story. The songs went on forever and weren't even catchy-I was bored out of my mind waiting for it to wrap up. By the end, it felt like they just slapped some sparkle on it to make a quick buck, and I'm kinda mad I wasted my time on it.",-/10
"Thoroughly enjoyed. Went in skeptical and prepared to dislike this modern live-action retelling of Disney's Snow White. Casting was fine and well acted. I enjoyed Pasek & Paul's new songs...think mixture of Greatest Showman with Disney sound. Ziegler's voice is a highlight. I thought the seven dwarfs were hilarious and great; very cgi but it worked. A great mix of modern and nostalgia. If I want to see the original, I'll just watch the original. What didn't work for me was costuming/look of Jonathan (new character love interest for Snow White, just a bit too grungy bohemian of a look), and the Evil Queen's song was too whimsical. Otherwise, great movie. I didn't look at my watch once in the theater, which is common for me if movie is overly long or boring me. Go see it, if only to form your own opinion.",8/10
"Snow White is not a bad movie. It is hardly a masterpiece either. The movie, although beautifully made, lacks the gentle beauty of the classic 1937 animation. The good intentions in making this movie and the goal to modernize it for younger audiences can be well seen, but was it really necessary?

From a song in which Snow White actually gives consent to the ""prince"" character prior to her eating the poison apple, to poor character development, inclusion of pointless characters and toning down of the Evil Queen's scary and devilish looming presence, the movie seems to be a patchwork quilt of some politically correct behavior, a not very deep story (although it tries to be), characters we know and love and some new ones we're introduced to and don't really get to know (and never do).

Rachel Zeggler both acts and sings beautifully and her theme song is a show stopper. Her vocals I dare say are clearer than Halle's Part of Your World. Now, Gal Gadot (oh boy) plays a flowy and way too over the top Evil Queen, that unfortunately is but a far dying echo of the Evil Queen in the animation.

Production problems and reshoots can be clearly seen when Snow White's hair distractingly changes both length and style, sometimes in the very same music sequence.

Speaking of music sequence, the Evil Queen absolutely did not need songs of her own, what breaks her character and makes us lose credibility in her evilness. She just feels...goofy.

I personally also felt a slight little political theme here and there, but that might just be me.

That being said, again the movie is not bad. It's CUTE and endearing but a little stale, like a cookie that's not very well baked, but it still ok. The visuals and CGI are stunning and, yes, I can see some uncanny valley happening with the dwarfes but nothing distracting or creepy at all. They look amazing nonetheless and the details are jaw dropping (Dopey was actually my favorite character in the movie).

However, it trying too hard to be politically correct (""and evidently so"") and to please everyone are what make the experience only a little less enjoyable.",6/10
"Gone are the days of Disney magic. In its place are cheap CGI effects, uncanny valley troll monsters called dwarves, and terrible acting by the beautiful Gal Gadot. A sad rendition of an epic classic. Don't waste your money. I wish I hadn't.

Most of the dialogue is straight up exposition where the characters explain to the audience what's going on and how their world works. The unwritten rule of movie making is to show, not tell. Explaining things we don't care about gets old fast, and they do a lot of just that.

It's hard to explain how disappointed I was in this farce. I really wanted to like it.",1/10
"Right, well if I'm honest, that new Snow White film were a real disappointment. It looked stunning in parts, I'll give it that, but there were nowt behind it. Rachel Zegler didn't bring much to the role - felt like she were just goin' through the motions half the time. I kept waitin' for summat to click, but it never did. Gal Gadot as the Queen weren't much better - all style, no real menace. And those CGI creatures they stuck in place of the dwarfs? Soulless, they were. Took all the heart out o' the story.

The whole thing just felt hollow, like they'd spent that much time tryin' to make it look pretty, they forgot folk actually want a decent tale. Pacing were all over the place - dragged in parts, rushed in others - and not a single song stuck with me after. By the end, I weren't bothered what happened to any of 'em. It's a shame, really. You'd think with all that budget and talent, they'd have managed summat a bit more memorable. Instead, it's just another one o' them remakes that'll be forgotten soon enough.",1/10
"Something is off, wery off.

I just have an eerie feeling in my mind, and I know exactly why.

Skipping the story, going directly to the glaring issue.

The film never connects with me as a viewer. Something always reminds me that what I am seeing is fake. And sure, I know that Alien, ET, Terminator and Avatar also was fake, but there are key differences to those movies and Snow white. I love Terminator, one of the best action movies ever mad. And Avatar left me disappointed with the real world, to gray and boring.

Snow White, it never connects.

The story is written as if it's only purpose is to meet the schedule or budget. Write something that fits into 1 hour and 45 minutes.

The acting feels forced and like Rachel said: I didn't like the original movie. Translation: I want fame and money, but I dont care for the movie or viewer.

And storytelling, just fits the standard Hollywood motto. Nothing that challenge or makes me connect.

And the sets, everything feels and looks fake. An edited Rachel in an edited Forrest, with fake elves.

How on earth do Disney expect me to enjoy this film? It's fake, it's off and I know you only made it out of greed. Pushed out of a factory with one purpose: We have the rights to the movie, let's milk it and hope for the best.",2/10
"Disney's 2025 Snow White remake attempts a modernized take on the beloved classic but ultimately struggles with execution. Rachel Zegler delivers a good performance, bringing some charm and depth to the character, yet the overall story feels disjointed and lacks the emotional weight of the original. The decision to use CGI dwarfs instead of practical effects or real actors is disappointing, as it removes much of the warmth and personality that made them so memorable. Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen fails to capture the menace and intensity of the original character, with her performance feeling somewhat flat and lacking the gravitas needed to make her a truly compelling villain. While the film is visually stunning, featuring beautiful set designs and vibrant cinematography, its uneven pacing and underwhelming narrative prevent it from making a lasting impact. These issues are reflected in its poor box office performance, grossing only $100 million against a staggering $350 million budget. A more cohesive balance between nostalgia and innovation, along with a stronger script and character development, could have made for a much more compelling adaptation.",1/10
"The acting is flat and uninspired, with performances that feel forced. This film is an absolute failure on every level, completely lacking the magic, charm, and heart that made the original story so beloved. From the very beginning, it feels uninspired, with flat performances, dull dialogue, and a lifeless atmosphere that fails to create any real emotional connection. The pacing is inconsistent, dragging in places where it should be engaging, making the entire experience feel like a chore to sit through. Visually, it fails to impress despite its massive budget, relying on inconsistent CGI and uninspired production design that lacks creativity. The film tries to be something new but ends up feeling forced and soulless, as if it was made with no real passion or understanding of what makes a great fantasy movie. It lacks excitement, depth, and entertainment value, making it one of the most forgettable and disappointing films in recent memory. Audiences deserve better than this lazy, uninspired mess that does nothing to justify its existence.",1/10
"We live in a time with limitless possibilities as far as movies go and Disney really could have done something special here. A live action remake of one of the most iconic stories ever, and they just botched it completely. The movie was set for failure from the very beginning, the choice of the snow white actress and using cgi for the seven dwarfs just killed this movie months ago. And don't get me wrong, I'm not 1 starring just because of some ""actor"" choices, the movie itself is just rubbish, the cgi is ridiculously bad and the acting wasn't good either. A 300M movie should have been perfect.",-/10
"S this the greatest Disney film of all time? No, probably not. Was it 10x better than the original? Absolutely.

This version keeps the charm of the original (fair-headed, kind princess beloved by her kingdom) but adds way more heart and actual entertainment value. It's not some massive rewrite like the internet warned. It's surprisingly faithful to the character and the spirit of the story.

I expected to hate it. I didn't. I actually sat through it and enjoyed it, which is more than I can say for the original. That one was rough. This one? It's got heart, it moves, and it works. Give it a chance.",10/10
"For all the questionable controversies that the Internet created about this film long before it came out, with the only justifiable one being the more than understandable tiredness of the Disney live action remakes, now that I've seen it I say: what a bunch of fuss for nothing. Yes, there's not much here that deserves acclaim and there are clear problems, although none of them involve the controversies of the Internet, but in the end there is absolutely nothing here that deserves hate or controversy. Out of the Disney remakes so far this is nowhere near being one of the worst, in fact I'd say it's actually one of the best, even though it's not a very close competition in this club. It's a weird case because there's a lot to like here, but unfortunately there are many problems in the mix that prevent it from reaching its full potential, with two of them in particular that are quite substantial. The first is Gal Gadot who unfortunately is very bad in the film and just doesn't match with the rest of the cast, even with her beautiful looks. And the second is the extremely hideous design of the dwarves, which really gets in the way of some of the good scenes with them and I could never get used to it. The rest are just adjustments and improvements that I think would have polished the story better, given it more development and room to marinate properly. But fortunately, what saves the experience from all of this is that even if it never reaches perfection, the changes and messages made in this reimagining are still very interesting, and the main star manages to carry the film on her shoulders.

Rachel Zegler is truly wonderful here, you can see that she gave her body and soul to this role and she is the definition of a true Disney princess in the flesh, with the voice of an angel and charisma exploding on screen. She is probably the best Disney Princess of these new live action versions, not only because of the actress's work itself but because I liked everything they did to reimagine Snow White, a character I never loved. Instead of keeping the character archaic like in the original animated feature, or just changing everything about her, they managed to create an arc for her that maintains all the best qualities and essence of the character from the 1937 film, but still updating her for today. She sees herself as a helpless maiden who is incapable of solving things on her own, but through the course of the story she learns that she is more than capable of being brave and strong just as she is. She can help in a fight without knowing how to fight, she can fall in love with someone and still have her own agency, and she can very well achieve what she wants even though she's just someone who wants to be a good person and not step on others to do so, like the Evil Queen does. Not only do I think this is a great idea that keeps the character true to her origins with a modern twist, but it also sends a very smart and sweet message, especially to young girls who so far seem to be the audience that are enjoying the film the most, and for good reason.

Otherwise, I found the production to be mostly very solid and well cared for. The cinematography is full of vibrant colors which is refreshing compared to the many grey filled remakes we got, very detailed sets and surprisingly excellent CGI work. The kingdom itself is the only area that doesn't impress much, it just looks like another medieval kingdom with nothing that stands out, unlike the forests or the dwarves' house for example. The dwarves themselves, despite their terrible design, have some good moments as characters, especially with what they do to Dopey and the musical number ""Whistle While You Work"" which is the best moment of the film. The songs from the original were updated appropriately I would say, so that they could fit in with the new songs and have their own identity without clashing with their classic melodies. As for the new songs, I really liked ""Waiting on a Wish"" and ""A Hand Meets a Hand"", and the musical number along with the melodies of ""All is Fair"" is pretty cool but Gal Gadot's singing unfortunately gets in the way. The rest is serviceable and has some cute moments of choreography or character interaction, but nothing too memorable beyond those I mentioned. And finally, I liked the change made to the prince, who here is a very different character and Andrew Burnap is charming in the role, but the group of bandits that accompanies him have little to do and could have easily been removed from the film.

In the end, despite my fears going into it, I enjoyed this new version of ""Snow White"", even if there is a lot in it that holds it back from being truly special. It's the kind of film that I want to give a higher score for the things I really liked about it, from the good messages to the excellent work of Zegler or the beautiful visuals. But it's undeniable that it is a turbulent experience with a lot of ups and downs. If you can forgive its missteps enough, there's plenty in here that I think is worth checking out, but I can understand those who could not get past them and end up not liking it. But considering the very low expectations I had, the fact that I got some positive and memorable stuff out of it already makes me quite happy, because there are valuable qualities in it that I really appreciated. I can totally see an audience for it that will really enjoy the experience, and despite having many reservations to make, I will certainly be more on the positive side. At least this remake tries to create something fresh without sacrificing everything from the original with some success, and even though it's not free from some of the old issues that all these remakes suffer from, it still manages to have more merits than many of them. I'll happily take more of this then another ""Lion King (2019)"" thank you very much.",6/10
"The new Snow White movie is a glaring example of how reboots can miss the mark when trying too hard to modernize a classic story. While the film attempts to update the themes and characters for a contemporary audience, it ultimately sacrifices the heart and magic that made the original so beloved.

One of the most glaring issues is the weak writing. The dialogue often feels forced, with characters delivering lines that seem more focused on making a statement than advancing the story naturally. The plot itself is a far cry from the whimsical charm of the original, coming across as overly complicated yet emotionally hollow.

The casting decisions, while bold, fail to deliver. The lead performance lacks the charisma and warmth required to carry the film, making it difficult to connect with the character. Even the supporting cast struggles to shine, with underwhelming portrayals of iconic roles that feel uninspired and forgettable.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some scenes boast impressive production design, others are marred by unconvincing CGI that detracts from the overall experience. The cinematography fails to capture the enchanting, storybook-like quality one would expect from a Snow White adaptation.

Perhaps the most disappointing aspect is the lack of emotional resonance. Where the original thrived on themes of love, kindness, and courage, this version feels more like a lifeless attempt to tick off boxes of modern trends rather than a heartfelt retelling.

Overall, the new Snow White feels like a shallow, uninspired attempt to cash in on nostalgia while alienating fans of the original. Instead of capturing the timeless magic of the story, it leaves you longing for the charm and simplicity of the 1937 classic.",1/10
"If you want to preserve the cherished memories of your childhood, I strongly advise against watching this movie. Some stories are best left untouched, remaining as beautiful, nostalgic moments in our minds. However, this film takes those beloved memories and distorts them into something unrecognizable. If you grew up loving the original tale, this adaptation may leave you feeling disappointed, disheartened, or even frustrated.

Furthermore, if you have children and are considering taking them to see this movie, you may want to think twice. Children are especially sensitive to visuals, and this film, rather than offering a magical, heartwarming experience, may instead introduce them to unnecessary fear. If your goal is to protect them from nightmares, then it would be wise to choose another film, one that truly embodies the spirit of wonder and adventure that fairy tales are meant to inspire. Rather than enchanting young viewers, this movie might unsettle them, leaving them with eerie images rather than joyful dreams.

One of the few redeeming qualities of the film might be the seven CGI dwarfs. In a movie that struggles in many other aspects, the visual effects team seems to have done a commendable job in bringing these characters to life. The animation and rendering of the dwarfs are well-executed, offering some of the only moments of genuine charm throughout the film. While CGI in modern films can often feel artificial or lifeless, the dwarfs in this adaptation manage to have some personality and visual appeal, providing at least a small highlight in an otherwise lackluster experience.

However, impressive CGI alone is not enough to save a film that falters in storytelling, character development, or emotional depth. While the technology used to create the dwarfs might be impressive, it does little to mask the shortcomings of the film as a whole. A movie should offer more than just visual spectacle-it should captivate, inspire, and transport its audience into a world worth believing in. Unfortunately, this adaptation fails to achieve that, leaving viewers with little more than a sense of disappointment.

In the end, if you value the magic and purity of the story you once knew, this film might not be the right choice for you. There are plenty of other adaptations and interpretations of classic fairy tales that do justice to their original magic and wonder. Instead of risking the disappointment that this movie might bring, consider revisiting the versions of the story that made you fall in love with it in the first place. Whether it's an animated classic, a beautifully written book, or even a stage adaptation, there are countless ways to experience the magic of this story without subjecting yourself to an underwhelming film.

For those who are still curious about the movie, perhaps the best approach is to manage expectations. If you go in expecting a faithful, heartfelt adaptation, you might leave feeling let down. But if you watch it with the understanding that it may take creative liberties, alter the tone, and possibly even stray far from the heart of the original, then you might be able to find small moments of enjoyment-especially in the CGI work. Just don't expect it to leave you with the same warmth and wonder that the original story once did.

Ultimately, the choice is yours, but be prepared. Whether it's protecting your childhood memories or shielding young viewers from unsettling imagery, there are valid reasons to be cautious about this film. If nothing else, at least we can acknowledge that the visual effects team put in the effort to make the seven dwarfs look good. Unfortunately, that alone may not be enough to make this movie worth watching.",1/10
"Oh boy, Disney's Snow White-where do I even start? This movie is like a poisoned apple that looks shiny on the outside but leaves you gagging after one bite. First off, Snow White herself is so annoyingly chipper, I half-expected her to break into a sales pitch for a timeshare with those woodland critters. Speaking of which, those animals deserve an Oscar for tolerating her off-key warbling while they scrub floors-meanwhile, I'm over here wishing the Evil Queen would hurry up with the inevitable.

The dwarves? More like seven little reasons to question my life choices. Grumpy's the only one with a brain, and even he couldn't save this snooze-fest. The plot moves slower than Sleepy after a double espresso wears off, and the Prince? Dude shows up for five seconds, kisses a coma patient without consent, and we're supposed to call it romance. Disney magic? More like Disney tragic. I'd rather watch paint dry-at least it wouldn't whistle while it worked. Two stars, and that's just for the Queen's mirror, who clearly knew how to throw shade.

In short, what a Total disaster and catastrophe . I can't imagine so much money and efforts were poured into this junk. This actress, the plots and pretty much everything in the movie were terrible. I'd rather be tortured by Ryan's world on YouTube than watching this garbage.",1/10
"Disney's live-action Snow White is not just bad-it's an insult to the original classic. From the moment the film starts, it becomes painfully clear that this remake has no heart, no soul, and no reason to exist beyond squeezing money out of nostalgia.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is one of the biggest disappointments. Rather than exuding menace or charm, she delivers a bland, lifeless performance that feels more like a last-minute casting decision than a carefully chosen role. Her lack of depth makes the Queen more laughable than intimidating, turning an iconic villain into a forgettable mess.

The worst part? The film's attempt to ""modernize"" the story comes off as painfully forced and preachy. Instead of adding depth, it strips away the whimsy and wonder that made Snow White a beloved fairytale in the first place. The story drags through dull, uninspired dialogue, and any attempt at emotional weight feels hollow.

Visually, the film is another disaster. The excessive CGI looks cheap and artificial, making everything feel more like a second-rate video game than a big-budget Disney production. Instead of immersing the audience in a magical world, it actively pulls them out of the experience with lifeless backdrops and characters that feel oddly disconnected from their surroundings.

Disney had the opportunity to reimagine Snow White in a way that honored the original while bringing something new to the table. Instead, they delivered a soulless, joyless, and utterly forgettable film that nobody asked for.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is an absolute disaster, a lifeless, uninspired mess that should have never been made. It strips away everything magical about the original and replaces it with dull performances, awful CGI, and atrocious writing.

Rachel Zegler is a complete miscast. She lacks any warmth or charm, delivering her lines with the enthusiasm of a bored teenager forced to do homework. She doesn't embody Snow White-she looks and sounds like she doesn't even want to be there.

The CGI dwarfs are hideous. Instead of the beloved original characters, we get creepy, soulless abominations that look like they crawled out of a failed video game.

The script is a joke. It takes itself too seriously while also being completely forgettable. There's no heart, no magic-just bland, corporate-approved nonsense.

The visuals? Dull and artificial. The enchanted forest feels like a cheap green-screen set, and the costume design looks like something out of a bad school play.

The only saving grace is Gal Gadot. She's the one bright spot in this disaster, bringing elegance and presence to an otherwise soulless film. She deserved a better movie.

Disney should be ashamed of this mess. Watch the original instead-it's the only Snow White that matters.",1/10
"Without a doubt, one of the worst films ever made. It's an unwatchable mess of crude, unfunny sketches strung together with no real plot, featuring an A-list cast who all seem embarrassed to be there. The humor is tasteless, the writing is lazy, and the entire movie feels like a desperate attempt to be shocking rather than entertaining. The acting is atrocious, but that's mostly because the material gives the actors nothing to work with. It's not just bad-it's painful, and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. If you wanna waste your time, come watch this movie! It's a perfect day ruiner for anyone who wants to tank their day.",-/10
"As someone who watched both Snow Whites they're both a little different but not necessarily bad. Snow White (2025) hits all major key events that happened in the old movie while creating a new storyline where she saves her people. I think it's better this way as it shows how independent and brave women can be while still needing the help of others. All the songs were great except the ones sung by Gal where she was just yelling instead of actually singing.

This movie was made to fit the standards of kids, and no kid nowadays listen to slow orchestral music as others did before. I think this movie is truly great. People need to accept the fact that cinema is changing and not everything can stay the same forever.",9/10
"My wife and I caught Snow White (2025) in theaters this evening. The story follows a princess whose mother dies and whose father remarries. When he leaves for war, her stepmother reveals her true, diabolical nature. She orders Snow White to be killed in the woods, but when Snow White mysteriously disappears, the queen assumes she's dead-until she discovers otherwise and decides to handle things herself.

Directed by Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer), the film stars Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), Andrew Burnap (Spare Room), and Tituss Burgess (Dolemite Is My Name).

This was an uneven film-not as bad as some are saying, but far from great. There were aspects I really enjoyed: Gal Gadot delivered a fantastic performance, the costumes were impressive, and the magical elements of the woods and the dwarfs' house were well done. I particularly liked the sequence of Snow White running through the forest.

Unfortunately, the film relies too heavily on CGI, which makes it feel hollow. The dwarfs, aside from Grumpy (who pretty much carried the film), lacked personality. The love interest was a complete misfire-his look and demeanor felt more like a Gap commercial than the rugged, Robin Hood-type character the story needed. The songs were more miss than hit, and while the ending was solid, the film as a whole just left me wanting more.

In conclusion, Snow White isn't a total waste of time, but it's far from the classic it could have been. I'd give it a 6/10.",6/10
"This production had some bad mojo-advertising by attacking the audience from preproduction to the release.

The movie isnt uplifting elther and although the budget was high the quality is lacking. The cgi looks like moving clay rather than real and imo it was a mistake not hiring real actors playing the dwarfs. The main character, Snow White, played by rachel ziegler doesnt work for me either, she doesnt fit the role on any plane. She doesnt look like the Snow White of the original story and comes off goofy and annoying rather than lovely.

The story also doesnt follow the origional and not to the better, it seems to me this movie is an attempt to rewrite history.

Gal gadot playing the evil queen doesnt fit for me either but she is a better fit than rachel ziegler and an immensely better actor.

Im also not a fan of musicals so this was not for me.

3/10.",3/10
"This movie completely misses the mark by stripping away the character's signature softness and warmth. Rachel Zegler's Snow White comes across more frustrated than kind, often sounding angry rather than hopeful or gentle. While she has a strong voice, it doesn't fit the character, making her feel more like a rebellious heroine than the classic princess.

Gal Gadot's Evil Queen doesn't help either her performance feels stiff and uninspired, she sounded bored and it completely took away the charm.

The CGI dwarfs are another misstep, looking awkward and unnatural, which only adds to the film's disjointed feel.",2/10
"Snow White in 2025 is a soulless, uninspired cash grab that insults the intelligence of audiences. This ""reimagining"" of a beloved classic is a grotesque caricature, devoid of charm, artistry, or any semblance of originality.

Rachel Zegler, saddled with a thankless role, delivers a performance as flat as the film itself. Her Snow White is a pale imitation of the vibrant, iconic character we know and love. Gal Gadot, miscast as the Evil Queen, chews scenery with the subtlety of a bulldozer. Her campy villainy is neither frightening nor entertaining, merely laughable.

The CGI is a disaster. The ""dwarfs"" are an uncanny valley nightmare, a grotesque mockery of human beings. The lush, vibrant world of the original is replaced by a sterile, CGI-heavy landscape that feels more like a video game than a fairy tale.

The musical numbers are forgettable, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the pacing is glacial. Snow White is a cinematic abomination that should be avoided at all costs.

This film is a testament to everything that's wrong with Hollywood today: a cynical attempt to capitalize on nostalgia, devoid of creativity or respect for the source material.

Save yourself the time and the torment. Go watch the original. It's a masterpiece compared to this insult.",1/10
"The Snow White remake is a huge disappointment. Disney removed the magic and charm of the original, replacing them with a dull and soulless version that barely resembles the classic. The story changes feel unnatural, the characters lack depth, and even the visuals fail to impress. The absence of the iconic Seven Dwarfs further adds to the feeling of failure. Instead of honoring a timeless fairy tale, this remake feels unnecessary and will easily be forgotten. The original Snow White will remain a classic forever, while this version will quickly fade into obscurity and be remembered as a misstep.",1/10
"Rachel Zegler's Snow White is a cinematic catastrophe that fails on every level. This soulless, cringeworthy abomination is a travesty that insults the very concept of storytelling. With a 1/10 rating from critics and audiences alike, it's clear that this movie is a complete and utter disaster.

The first issue is the script, which is a jumbled mess of clichés and poorly written dialogue. The characters are paper-thin, with Snow White herself being a blank slate with no discernible personality. The Seven Dwarfs are reduced to mere caricatures, with no depth or development. The villain, the Evil Queen, is a one-dimensional caricature with no motivation or backstory.

The acting is equally atrocious, with Rachel Zegler struggling to convey any sense of emotion or charisma. Her Snow White is a wooden, unengaging presence on screen, with all the charm and warmth of a damp sock. The supporting cast fares no better, with the usually reliable Gal Gadot and Ben Kingsley phoning in their performances.

The direction is equally uninspired, with Chris Buck and Marc Webb failing to bring any sense of wonder or magic to the proceedings. The action scenes are dull and uninspired, with the special effects looking like they were ripped straight from a video game. The music is forgettable and unmemorable, with none of the iconic songs from the original Disney classic making an appearance.

But perhaps the biggest problem with Snow White is its complete lack of originality. The story is a lazy retread of the original fairy tale, with no new twists or surprises to speak of. The film's attempts at humor fall flat, with the jokes feeling forced and unnatural. The pacing is slow and plodding, with long stretches of boring exposition that fail to engage.",1/10
"I just wasted two hours of my life on this pile of garbage that is the new Snow White. This movie sucks so bad it's almost impressive-like, how do you even fail this hard at a story everyone already knows? The acting was wooden enough to build a log cabin, the dialogue sounded like it was written by a toddler with a thesaurus, and the CGI looked like a cheap video game from 2003. They butchered every ounce of charm from the original tale and replaced it with a cringe-fest of forced messages and zero chemistry between the characters. The dwarves? More like dwarfed by the sheer incompetence of this production. Save your money, save your time, save your soul-skip this abomination.",-/10
"#SnowWhite is an absolute visual feast! They pretty much did the original story mix with some of the original grim Brothers story and added some new things. Acting was pretty much good for the whole film. The only thing I think they could've done better, was to make Gal Gadot do a little bit more evil as an evil queen. Rachel was very good at playing Snow White. Some songs were added, which I don't think needed to. I don't think the film deserves as much hate it's getting yes it's not perfect or amazing, but I enjoyed a lot of it! My personal opinion for people is to not pay attention to the negative reviews and just going with an open mind that that's how I went in even though there were negative reviews that I read I was nervous going in, but I'm still happy I saw it! My rotten tomatoes 🍅 score would be 70% not a 46% like they gave it.",7/10
"I was there watched this movie, and it this movie, and it was absolute disappointed. Why i'm use words "" A Live action Disney Folly"". Compared to the original version, Snow White and the Seven dwarfs animated version is better than the remakes. Disney has continued to prove that live-action remakes of classic animated tales are getting tiresome and unoriginal. As Gold Member of D23, rachel zegler is the one who blame with, she's disrespecting the movie ever since she put her mouth at the D23 Expo 2 years ago and i'm tired of being humbled I'm tired to be speechless, if Walt is alive, he'll fire her for good.

Besides The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon remake being pretty good, the other remakes have remained dull, baffling, or offensive and even worse, disrespecting the original animate movie. Snow White is one of those dull ones Absolute horrid . Covered with excessive usages of CGI and colors, the camerawork, production style and colors feel bloated and unsocial.

Alongside with the bland direction, uninteresting takes of how they tell the tale and where the characters were once beloved in the animated movie, becomes lifeless and uninteresting here. The choice of using CGI dwarfs really was a bad idea because it came off as quite uncanny and unintentionally creepy to observe at times.

The performances....aren't very great. Rachel Zegler does give her best as she does have solid moments including some of the voice performances from the other cast. Gal Gadot, however, her performance really didn't work at all. Gadot lacks the emotion and creep charm to what the Evil Queen should have been. Queen should have been.

Rachel Zegler: A Snow White Lacking Charm Casting Rachel

Zegler as Snow White seemed like an interesting choice, but unfortunately, her performance falls flat. While her singing ability is undeniable, her acting lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the character. Instead of a sweet and kindhearted princess, this Snow White comes across as distant, and at times, even uninterested in the story unfolding around her. Her line delivery feels forced, and there's little emotional connection between her and the world she's supposed to inhabit.

Weak CGI and Bland Visuals: For a film with Disney's budget, the CGI is shockingly subpar.

The enchanted forest, which should have felt lush and immersive, looks artificial, and the CGI creatures lack the expressiveness and charm of their animated counterparts.

The dwarfs-who have been controversially reimagined-look awkward and unnatural, making it hard to emotionally invest in their presence. The visual effects in Snow White feel rushed, and instead of enhancing the experience, they serve as a constant distraction.

Music: A Forgettable Soundtrack The one highlight o film is Zegler's singing, but even that can't save the uninspired and generic new songs. Unlike Disney's previous

Despite some good looking designs on the backgrounds and all, it was really boring. Marc Webb tries his best but unfortunately, really little about this would ever work.

Please, audiences for gods sake. Stop giving the remakes a chance. Save the money and go watch Snow White and the seven dwarfs (1937) instead of the live action Disney folly. This is my honest review no offensive instead against the company. I'm not recommend this movie. 2/10 worst Disney remake ever.",1/10
"It's good but should be inspired from Snow White not official Snow White.

""Disappointed"" is my word for this movie feels inadequate when describing my reaction to this film. Marketed as a fresh take, ""inspired by"" the classic tale, it quickly revealed itself to be a disappointingly truncated and seemingly rushed rendition of Disney's Snow White. The initial excitement of seeing a familiar story reimagined was swiftly replaced by a sense of melancholic recognition, a realization that this was less a creative inspiration and more a hollow echo of the original. This isn't to say the film was devoid of merit; certain visual elements were striking, and a few performances held promise. However, the overall experience was marred by a pervasive sense of missed opportunity.

The most glaring flaw was the film's jarring pacing. It felt as though crucial scenes were excised, leaving gaping holes in the narrative. Character development, a cornerstone of any compelling story, was sacrificed at the altar of brevity. Moments that should have resonated emotionally fell flat, due to the lack of necessary context and build-up. The relationship between the protagonist and their companions, intended to be a source of warmth and camaraderie, felt superficial and underdeveloped. Similarly, the antagonist's motivations, which could have been explored with nuance and depth, were reduced to a caricature of villainy. The film's insistence on adhering to the basic plot points of the original, while simultaneously rushing through them, resulted in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.

This sense of incompleteness was particularly disheartening considering the rich potential of the Snow White story. The themes of innocence, envy, and transformation are timeless, offering ample room for creative exploration. Yet, this film seemed content to merely skim the surface, failing to delve into the psychological complexities of its characters or the symbolic depth of its narrative. The ""inspired by"" label felt like a deceptive marketing ploy, a way to lure in audiences with the promise of something new, only to deliver a diluted and rushed imitation of a beloved classic.

Would I recommend this film to my friends? Absolutely not. The one-hour runtime, while seemingly efficient, felt like a disservice to the source material. It was a wasted hour, an hour that could have been spent engaging with a film that truly understood the essence of Snow White. Compared to the masterful adaptations of Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin-films that managed to both honor their origins and forge their own distinct identities-this film felt like a pale imitation. Those films understood that taking the original, and adding to it, and making it their own, is the key to a successful movie. This Snow White inspired film, however, falls short. It lacked the heart, the depth, and the creative spark necessary to truly capture the magic of the original tale, leaving a lingering sense of disappointment and a yearning for a more inspired and fulfilling cinematic experience.",1/10
"This is not Snow White in any way-neither the story, the characters, nor the narrative. It should have just been named ""A Girl and an Evil Queen"".

I struggle to understand why studios drastically alter beloved stories instead of creating something new. A tale that has stood the test of time does so because of its themes, characters, and essence. Changing 80% of what made it a classic begs the question-why even call it the same story? At that point, it's less an adaptation and more a new narrative borrowing a familiar name.

It often seems like a marketing tactic, leveraging nostalgia and a built-in audience while delivering something barely recognizable. If they truly wanted to tell a fresh story, they could simply create one-perhaps ""inspired by"" the original. That way, they could modernize or innovate without alienating fans who love the classic for what it is.

Ironically, such drastic changes often lead to backlash rather than success. Fans feel betrayed, while new audiences may not connect with something that has lost its original magic. A well-crafted original story, even if influenced by an existing one, would likely be received far better than a hollow rewrite of something iconic.",1/10
"Disney's new live-action Snow White is a colossal disappointment that fails to recapture the timeless enchantment of its classic animated version. The film is riddled with a poorly constructed narrative that feels both forced and unimaginative, relying on stale tropes and clumsy dialogue. Characters are one-dimensional and lack any meaningful development, leaving the audience disconnected. Even the visual effects, which strive for grandeur, end up looking awkward and unconvincing. Overall, this misguided adaptation is a complete misfire that earns a dismal score of 1/10. Utterly, complete flop.",1/10
"Costume Design Inconsistencies:

A notable example is the character Jonathan's attire, which includes a modern jean jacket and hoodie. This choice clashes with the film's intended fantasy setting, leading to a disjointed visual experience.

Visual Effects and Character Representation:

The depiction of the seven dwarfs through CGI has been a point of contention. The animated dwarfs resemble lawn gnomes, which some viewers found awkward and lacking the charm of the original characters.

Narrative and Tonal Issues:

The film introduces complex new subplots but struggles to maintain a consistent tone. This results in a narrative that feels disjointed and fails to engage the audience effectively.

Character Portrayals:

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen has been criticized for lacking menace, with her performance oscillating between menacing and campy, leading to an inconsistent character depiction.

Controversial Modern Updates:

The film's attempt to modernize the classic tale, including changes to traditional elements and themes, has sparked debates among audiences. Some appreciate the effort to update the story, while others feel it deviates too far from the beloved original.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is an absolute trainwreck of a film, a soulless, pandering mess that takes everything magical about the original and grinds it into a pile of corporate-approved sludge. From the moment the film starts, it's clear that no one involved actually cared about the heart of the story-instead, we're subjected to a joyless, preachy rehash that feels like it was assembled by a boardroom of executives desperate to check off every modern talking point rather than tell a compelling fairy tale. Rachel Zegler's Snow White is a complete misfire, a character so stripped of her original warmth and kindness that she might as well be an entirely different person. Gone is the gentle, hopeful princess who charmed animals and won over the dwarfs with her sincerity; in her place is a smirking, self-righteous bore who delivers cringeworthy one-liners and spends more time lecturing the audience than embodying any real fairy-tale spirit. Zegler's performance lacks any trace of the wide-eyed wonder that made Snow White iconic-instead, she comes across as disinterested, almost annoyed to be in the role, and her singing, while technically fine, feels autotuned and devoid of emotion, as if even the music was an afterthought in this hollow production. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is another colossal disappointment, a villain who should have been a scene-stealing force of malice but instead stumbles through the film with all the intimidation of a disgruntled influencer. Gadot looks the part, sure, but her delivery is wooden, her menace nonexistent, and her attempts at dramatic flair fall completely flat. The famous ""Mirror, Mirror"" scene, once a chilling highlight of the original, is reduced to a lifeless exchange with zero tension, thanks to terrible pacing and a script that seems determined to undermine any sense of stakes. The Queen's backstory, a half-baked attempt at forced sympathy, only makes her less compelling, robbing her of the pure, delicious wickedness that made her such a memorable antagonist. Then there are the dwarfs-or rather, the bizarre, identity-less creatures Disney has replaced them with in a transparent attempt to dodge controversy. Stripped of their distinct personalities, they're reduced to a bland, interchangeable group of CGI-enhanced nobodies who contribute nothing to the story. There's no Grumpy, no Dopey, no Sleepy-just a handful of forgettable sidekicks who exist solely to nod along to Snow White's uninspiring monologues. The decision to sideline them in favor of this watered-down, politically safe alternative is cowardly, and worse, it's boring, sucking out yet another layer of charm from what should have been a lively, whimsical adventure. Even the Prince, already a thinly written character in the original, is somehow made even more irrelevant, appearing only long enough to remind us that Disney had no idea what to do with him. The romance, if you can even call it that, is completely lifeless, with zero chemistry between the leads and a rushed, unconvincing ""connection"" that feels like it was added out of obligation rather than any genuine storytelling need. The film's visuals are just as uninspired, with cheap-looking CGI backdrops and a color palette so dull it feels like the movie was shot through a layer of grime. The enchanted forest, once a place of wonder, now resembles a low-budget video game cutscene, and the animals-previously a delightful part of Snow White's world-move with all the natural grace of glitchy robots. The musical numbers, supposedly one of Disney's biggest strengths, are shockingly forgettable, with new songs that evaporate from memory the second they end and reworked classics that lack any of the original's spark. The humor, what little there is, lands with a thud, relying on painfully forced modern quips that clash horribly with the fairy-tale setting. Every creative decision in this film feels calculated, focus-grouped, and utterly devoid of passion, as if the entire production was engineered to avoid offending anyone rather than to entertain. The result is a movie that pleases no one-too sanitized to satisfy fans of the original, too bland to win over new audiences, and too afraid of its own legacy to take any real risks. It's a film that exists solely because Disney knows the name ""Snow White"" will sell tickets, no matter how little effort they put into it. By the time the limp, anticlimactic finale rolls around, the only emotion it inspires is relief that it's finally over. This isn't just a bad remake-it's a depressing testament to how far Disney has fallen, trading timeless storytelling for hollow, market-tested mediocrity. If this is the future of their live-action adaptations, then maybe it's time they just stopped making them altogether.",1/10
"Disgraceful to the original. This movie is very much clearly a failed attempt at a money making scheme. We the audience understands the need to make money and to modernize a movie, however this is a shameful attempt at that. In my 130 years of experience I have never seen such a failure of a recreating as this movie. The acting is akin to a bland tasteless dry clump of flour. No substance, just an excuse for food. The production resembles a 400 dollar bill for a flavorless piece of gum. The amount of money poured into this movie does not match what the outcome should have been. And it is clear to the producers that they have failed, shamefully at that, and it is obvious to the audience.",1/10
"Wow, if that's the fairest of them all, I think we need a new standard for beauty! There could be a better representation of such an iconic character. After the disappointing casting of Ariel in The Little Mermaid, Disney done it again with Snow White. Rachel's portrayal is a far cry from the enchanting princess we all grew up loving. The princess characters, once symbols of beauty and grace, have been tarnished by poor casting choices. It feels like my childhood memories of these beloved princesses have been utterly destroyed. I hope Disney takes a step back and reconsiders its approach to casting in future adaptations, because these missteps are truly disheartening.",-/10
"Beautifully made Disney movie. Don't believe the bad reviews in the media by the haters. This is a movie made for children and my three children really really enjoyed it. First half of the movie is mostly very loyal to the original characters and story. The second half of the movie has some slight differences and additions to the plot of the original to help convert this from a 1930s animation to a modern 2025 live action movie. It's far from perfect of course with some cringy or cheesy bits thrown in, but it really doesn't deserve the controversy or hate towards some of the cast. It's worth seeing with children without a doubt and Rachel Zegler is a beautiful Snow White.",9/10
"Controversies aside, i quite enjoyed the movie.

What worked:
Rachel Zegler's acting and singing. She surprisingly have life to Snow White (just ignore her bad wig, I still don't understand what the costume department was thinking.)
Dopey (loved the changes made to his character)
Jonathan and the way he was integrated to the story (Prince Charming was one of the weakest aspects of the original animated)
Character motivations also kind of worked for me.


What didn't work:










Overall, good enough watch. Some aspects felt better than the original animated to me personally. I wish Rachel Zegler wouldn't have ruined the marketing of the movie, because her off-screen behaviour kept lingering in my mind throughout the movie, no matter how hard I tried to separate the art from the artist.",7/10
"It Gets 1 Star For Being Perfunctory As Hell.

This isn't It

Here's my main 2 problems with the Film.

💤 1. The Build and Execution of the entire thing went like this ""This Happens, and then this Happens and then That Happened""

😐 2. Because of that, the film for vast Parts of it literally felt like it was going through the motions, just Unengaging & Lackluster as Hell.

Bonus Reason -

🌟 - And Here's a Bonus Reason, I Saw Wicked Twice, There's a Few Songs and Dance Routines In that Film that completely Blow anything in Snow White out of the Water. And that Ceiling Hitting High at the Very End of Wicked was Amazing to Experience.

You cannot Go From that to this, it's Pointless.

And Quite Frankly, Putting that into Perspective and in Comparison, this film is Almost an Absolute Disaster.",1/10
"For a movie steeped in the rich legacy of Disney's animated classic, Snow White 2025 falls flat in almost every department. Despite the potential for a modern, enchanting live-action remake, this film feels overly artificial and devoid of genuine magic.

The sets and visuals seem contrived, leaving the audience longing for the lush, immersive environments of the animated original. The portrayal of the dwarfs, which should have been charming and central to the story's heart, comes across as uninspired and awkwardly handled.

Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen is a major disappointment. While her striking appearance is undeniable, her portrayal lacks the depth and menace needed to embody such an iconic antagonist. Moreover, Snow White's costume design and hairstyle feel strangely out of place, failing to evoke the timeless elegance of the character.

The musical elements, a key part of Disney's charm, lack the memorable tunes and emotional resonance audiences hope for. The overall film suffers from a lack of coherence, making the experience more cringe-worthy than captivating.

Disney has certainly taken bold creative liberties here, but unfortunately, most of them miss the mark. In the end, this remake feels less like a tribute to a beloved classic and more like a shallow attempt to capitalize on nostalgia.",1/10
"Disney's 2025 Snow White is a baffling misfire-an uninspired, joyless attempt to modernize a classic that neither respects the original nor offers anything fresh. Despite boasting a talented cast and a massive budget, the film is a soulless spectacle weighed down by poor writing, awkward performances, and uninspired visuals. One of the film's biggest failures is its attempt to ""update"" Snow White by stripping away the very elements that made it a timeless fairy tale. Instead of a heartfelt story about kindness, resilience, and magic, we get a protagonist who lacks charm and a narrative that feels cobbled together from corporate boardroom decisions. Rachel Zegler's Snow White is more of a generic ""strong female lead"" archetype than a character with depth, and the script never gives her room to develop beyond that.",1/10
"I took my niece to see this movie and was not too thrilled with the storyline and its complete departure from the actual storyline. We found the main Snow White character to be off putting. And that doesn't even include the unprofessional and offensive comments that have been said by this woman. I really don't know how Disney could allow this disaster to move forward. Disney has been on such a downward spiral the past decade. It's sad to see this once incredible company be destroyed over politics and radical societal pushes by a fringe part of the population.

This will be massive loss for Disney and the end of Rachel Ziegler's career.",1/10

"I even fell asleep and my 7 year ikd went all the movie saying... SO FAKE, Why is the Snow white angry? (just her face erupting his wokness bitter), why is the witch queen jealouse? She's prettier. Don't waste your money.

Disney's latest live-action Snow White is a complete disaster, failing on nearly every level. From its uninspired lead actress to its soulless CGI, the film is a far cry from the timeless charm of the original. Worse still, its rewritten dialogues strip away the warmth and values that made the classic story beloved, replacing them with a hollow, antisocial message that alienates its audience.

Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is one of the film's biggest weaknesses. She lacks the grace, innocence, and charm that made the original character so endearing. Instead of portraying a kind and humble princess, her version feels smug and detached, making it impossible to root for her. Her line delivery is often flat or overly self-assured, further distancing her from audiences expecting a sincere, heartfelt performance.

Visually, the film is just as unconvincing. The CGI-heavy effects strip the movie of any sense of realism or magic. The so-called ""dwarfs"" look like a lazy, computer-generated afterthought, draining the film of any personality. The artificial landscapes and overprocessed lighting make every scene feel plastic and soulless, turning what should be a visually rich fairytale into something that resembles a cheap video game cutscene.

Perhaps the most frustrating part is the film's complete disregard for the themes that made Snow White a beloved story in the first place. The rewritten dialogues turn what was once a tale of kindness, resilience, and family into an awkward, disjointed narrative that pushes an individualistic and almost antagonistic attitude toward traditional values. The result is a film that doesn't just fail to connect with the audience-it actively pushes them away.

In the end, Snow White is nothing more than a misguided, joyless attempt at modernizing a classic. Instead of honoring the legacy of the original, it distorts it beyond recognition, leaving audiences with nothing but disappointment.",1/10
"Once upon a time, in a land where Hollywood still understood storytelling, Snow White was a beloved fairy tale about beauty, magic, and the perils of vanity. Fast forward to today, and we now have this-a cinematic train wreck that takes a pickaxe to nostalgia and buries it in an unmarked grave.

Let's start with the most baffling issue: the Evil Queen is more beautiful than Snow White. That's not just a nitpick; it obliterates the entire premise. Why is she jealous? Does she have self-esteem issues? Did her magic mirror get hacked? Watching this film, you'd think the real villain is common sense itself.

Then there's the protagonist. Now, I don't care who plays Snow White, but at the very least, make the story make sense. The original description-skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, hair as black as ebony-isn't just some throwaway line; it's the reason the story exists. Ignoring that detail makes it feel like the writers skimmed the Wikipedia summary and said, ""Eh, close enough."" Spoiler: It wasn't.

The film is also hilariously devoid of charm. No whimsy, no heart, just a dull, self-important slog that takes itself way too seriously while simultaneously treating the source material like garbage. It's like watching a birthday clown perform Shakespeare-awkward, painful, and fundamentally wrong.

The only joy I got from this experience was the memes mocking it, which ironically had more creativity than the entire film. If you want to enjoy Snow White, do yourself a favor: stick to the animated classic or, better yet, just stare at a blank wall for two hours. You'll get the same amount of plot development, but at least you won't leave feeling personally attacked.",-/10

"Sorry to see so many negative reviews. I liked the movie. I loved the music the updated story and most of all the Queen's crown, jewelry and her robes. The Queen was a fun character. I am happy to see Snow White fight and not expect someone to rescue her. The dwarves were funny and dopey was my favorite. He looked like the Mad character. Like the movie for what it is and update on an old classic tale. I understand if it is not for everyone. I have been enjoying the sound track very much. I hope a collection of the jewelry come out. I would buy her crown and as much rings I could afford. Have a great day.",7/10
"Not great.

Let's just say that you will not be at the edge of your seat. There is no suspense at all at any point Too long and dragged out yet the ending is garbled. It felt like somewhere closer to the end of the second hour the creators said ""Hey, would you look at the time! Certainly time to finish this thing!"" So they did... In general, the queen was just not scary or evil enough. Snow White was not inspiring enough. Gal Gadot's performance was mediocre at best. Rachel's singing was good but acting lacked authenticity. The ""prince"" who wasn't even a prince was not likable. Just a guy off the street who played his rather confusing role poorly. It is hard to understand why the main characters supposedly fall in love with each other. There wasn't a point when a spark between them is seen. No chemistry whatsoever.

7 dwarfs who, it seems, were supposed to be some magical creatures, which would justifying their grotesque appearance, coexist with actual characters with dwarfism which is odd. Where did both types of ""dwarfs"" come from??

It seems that there is a song at every turn, yet no song is memorable enough. Not to mention Gal cannot sing and yet is given a song to struggle with... I can go on and on but the kids liked it so here are your two stars.",2/10
"I have never once in my life felt like I wasted my time before watching this. I didn't expect it to be particularly 'good' and albeit my expections were high because of the previous Snow white movie never in my wildest nightmare could i possibly imagine that it would be so bad that it makes Morbius look like a vincent van Gogh painting. This movie killed all my sentiments and feelings towards the previous Snow white. None of the characters are accurate the plot is all over the place, the world building is terrible the CGI dwarves deserves to be locked up in a prison. Even Lord of the Rings that came out in 2012 aka more than ten years prior to this disastrous dumpster fire had better character designs. I am just done at this point. Please don't waste your time money and sentiments watching this.",1/10
"I honestly don't know why Disney insist on doing Live Action remakes of their much loved cartoon films. While some of them have been quite good interpretations like 'The Jungle Book' and 'The Lion King', possibly because they follow the same storyline as the original, this one is truly awful. If they think aspects of the story are outdated or controversial now, why not do an original story instead of butchering a much loved classic. I didn't think it could be as bad as the reviews are saying, but it really is.

The CGI 'dwarves' look truly naff. Gal Gadot looks the part of the Evil Queen, but the acting is very unconvincing, and Rachel Zegler's Snow White doesn't even look the part.

I'm sorry I wasted my time.",2/10

"What I love about the original Snow White movie is how the character of Snow White embodies femininity, and her high-pitched and sweet tone of voice is truly mesmerizing. Unfortunately, the remake falls short of these standards. Moreover, the CGI dwarfs are just weird on so many levels and make the movie feel soulless. The film attempts to add magic, but ironically, it ends up losing the very magic and charm that made the original so beloved. The result is a flat, overly commercialized movie that completely strips away the classic elements that made the original so timeless. I understand that the filmmakers aimed to ""update"" the movie, but their efforts ultimately fall flat, stripping away the magic and wonder that make fairy tales so enchanting.",1/10
"Cuz this movie is chock full of it. Stinking, putrid, nauseating garbage.

Anytime a film is billed as ""reimagining"" a classic, that's new-speak code for ""made in a way that not only lacks charm, but goes the extra mile to offend people who enjoyed the original.

In the best moments it's very boring, but there aren't a lot of these ""best"" boring moments. Mostly you will have to endure bad acting, worse singing, cgi that is so off putting you have to close your eyes, and the whole time you're wondering what kind of hell your kid suckered you into watching.

Based on the hype, I was expecting an urban, hip, updated version of the original, which was made back in the Middle Ages, when humans first learned to draw pictures. Instead it's a ""reimagined"" version that lacks any appeal. If the original version has a soul, this version is its lifeless, zombie-Frankenstein evil descendant.

Put it this way, if you take your kid to see this, they'll resent you for the rest of their lives because they wanted to see a beautiful film and you took them to see a bunch of halfwits stumble around the screen looking like mindless zombies. If I wanted to see that I'd drive over to my sister-in-law's house and watch her family walk into walls.

Take my advice and pass on this one, otherwise your kids will resent you and I will to, because I've warned you.",1/10
"If you're thinking of giving it a chance then I really wouldn't bother. My only regret is not walking out of it before the end.

So much time, money and PR went into this. And the result is simply appalling. They promoted this as magical and adventurous but it's simply ridiculous and a disaster. The dwarves I can't get over - why not cast real human beings to the roles... Acting in here is no better than the rest of the movie. Gadot looks even quite good and how the wicked stepmother should look like in the end but oh boy the acting from her... I feel like I've already written more than I should waste my time here on this. Lets just add that the music is forgettable and everything else that actually made Snow White magical and good has been ripped out for this movie and made non present. The end result is just sad.",1/10
"This definitely was a great experience because, i got a refund WITHOUT QUESTIONS. There was a group of 10 children with some parents and ALL also asked for their money back. IT is very sad that Disney decided to damage such a beautiful story line. ""Quoting Zegler: WEIRD.... WEIRD"" exactly. She was weird, and I expected Galdot to make a big difference, but i was disappointed. The face snow white made in front of the Stairs at 18 minutes.... was the culmination of my lunch. I am happy that the Theater staff was understanding with the refund, they gave us a pass to enjoy a different movie. It was disappointing but the refund and FREE ticket to watch something else made up for it. The story line was damaged with this new ""TREND"" and it failed to deliver the expected outcome. I advise that if you wish to stay for more than 30 minutes, GO with the understanding that it is NOT going to be good, the story wont make sense, the changes done by the cast are horrible and the CGI......well...i will let you guys decide for yourselves.",-/10
"A film created for the youngest Disney fans. Featuring a princess who awakens to take her rightful place, inherited from her parents and that finds herself and becomes a queen. This movie gives the final the Evel Witch needed from the original animated classic and also context about Snow White's family. The best: Rachel Zegler voice. The worst: Gal Gadot, her portrayal looks more like a parody. The sweetest: The 7 Dwarfs, they are just cute. The messages: Human beauty is from the inside out. Together we are more powerful. What makes us great is our generosity and empathy, not material possessions.",7/10
"Once upon a time, Disney was the keeper of dreams-the studio that brought fairy tales to life with magic, wonder, and heart. But they shattered one of their most cherished legacies. Snow White is not a reimagining; it is a betrayal.

This is not Snow White. Not even close. They have taken a story that has enchanted generations and ripped its soul apart. The timeless tale of beauty, kindness, and resilience against evil has been twisted into something unrecognizable.

The heart of the legend-the very essence of what made Snow White endure for over a century-is missing. And what remains is an empty shell, a film that wears the name Snow White but has nothing of her spirit.

What made Snow White special? It wasn't just the poisoned apple, the Evil Queen, or the seven dwarfs. It was the fairytale magic. It was the ''pure-hearted girl who won hearts through her kindness'', not arrogance. It was the contrast between innocence and vanity, between good and evil. But this film has no reverence for its own source material.

Instead, it tears apart its own foundation, rewriting history and distorting what made Snow White an icon in the first place.

They didn't adapt Snow White - they erased her. The filmmakers didn't care about preserving the legend. They cared about turning it into something else entirely and slapping the name ''Snow White'' on it. If they wanted to tell a different story, fine-then call it something else! But don't take a beloved classic and distort it beyond recognition.

The Evil Queen is supposed to be ''terrifying''. A chilling embodiment of vanity, envy, and obsession. But here? Stripped of her operatic grandeur, reduced to something utterly forgettable. Where is the ''menace''? Where is the deliciously dark presence that made the original Queen one of Disney's greatest villains?

And the seven dwarfs? Well, if you've seen the discussions, you already know how that went.

This is what stings the most: Snow White is a foundational story. It was the film that made Disney what it is today - the very first animated feature, a cinematic revolution, a legacy passed down through generations. To discard that history so carelessly, to treat it as if it needs fixing when it was never broken to begin with... it's heartbreaking.

Disney has always reinvented fairy tales, but they've never erased their souls before.

This time, they have. They have taken one of their most sacred stories and destroyed its identity.

You want to make a new fantasy film? Great. You want a new heroine, a new world, a new take? Go for it. But don't pretend this is Snow White when it clearly isn't.

Call it ''The Forest Princess''. Call it ''The Magic Mirror''. Call it literally anything else. But don't call it ''Snow White'' - because this isn't her story.

This is not magic.

This is not wonder.

This is not ''Snow White''. Snow White - A Broken Fairytale.",1/10
"Save yourself the time, do anything else and it will be more fun.

Completely uninspired, lacking all fairy tale magic, the dwarves are hilariously unrealistic, the attempt to digitally make them look humanlike a complete flop. Dopey looks like Alfred E. Neuman from MAD Magazine which got a chuckle out of me and that's the only emotion I felt throughout this flop of a film.

Snow White's performance the only one worth saying anything positive about with the rest of the characters totally bland and boring.

I had to login to my imdb account after 7 years of not using it just for this, thats how bad it is and Disney should be ashamed of ruining yet another classic.",1/10
"Yes, the rumors you've been hearing are indeed true. This adaptation of Snow White feels hollow, completely lacking in genuine magic or charm.

The dialogues come off as forced and unnatural, almost as if the writers weren't sure themselves where the story was supposed to go. Speaking of the story, it struggles to find clarity or coherence, stumbling aimlessly from one scene to the next without any real sense of direction or purpose. Most of Disney's recent remakes haven't lived up to their originals, and this one is no exception. It felt as if Disney wanted to launch something but had no clear idea what or in which direction to go.

Rachel Zegler, who portrays Snow White, spends the entire movie looking like she's genuinely surprised she landed the role-and not in a good way. Her performance feels disconnected, as if she's impersonating Snow White rather than truly embodying her.

Honestly, a more accurate title for this movie would have been ""The Surprised Impostor Calling Herself Snow White,"" because that's exactly how it feels.",1/10
"This was worse than I expected and I expected it would be puss filled moldy garbage. Instead of wasting time and money on this garbage, Disney should have re-released the original. That would have been much cheaper. It would be an incredible marketing idea for Disney to re-release all of their classic movies; a new one every couple of months or so. The cost would be minimal so any sells would be almost entirely profit and they would not piss of the fans. And it might be a boon for the theater industry. Even if Disney doesn't want to re-release their classics, they should stop with effing remakes. The remakes are horrid because the ""entertainment"" industry is filled with incompetent buffoons. Stop with the remakes! Also, the modern audience is a lie. It doesn't exist.",1/10
"One of the worst Disney live-action remakes, and one of the worst Disney movies ever produced in their 88 years of filmmaking.

It's bad enough that Disney is remaking their first fully-animated feature film - their magnum opus - but this remake does nothing but a disservice to the legacy of the original and the legacy that Walt Disney left.

The filmmakers ""love Disney movies"" as said in the trailer above, but they did everything in their power to market how different this movie needs to be for ""modern audiences.""

And they do just that. They not only change the story in a major way, but they also cast an insufferable lead, even going as far to refuse roles from little people actors who wanted to play the dwarves.

As for the movie itself, the acting is horrid from Zegler and Gadot, the story is confusing, vapid, and meaningless. The movie is about an hour and a half, but feels longer than Oppenheimer.

If you loved the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, you'll hate this movie. Because it is far from the original Disney magic of long past.",1/10
"Don't waste your time on this useless movie. Gal Gadot is the worst actress! I don't understand the need to redo classics specially with people like Gal Gadot who can't act. Overall, the story has been reworked and doesn't hold one's attention. I would watch the classic snow white anytime but this movie is tasteless and would have needed a major overhaul to make it work. Yes, it's about the box office numbers, but they should've made a movie which would appeal to everyone instead of satisfying a few. The leads have a very short acting range and it shows.

"On behalf of me and everyone who agrees with this review, to all of the fallen comrades who had to sit through this nightmare either to write a review or because your kids dragged you to it, we salute you!

""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and its long-lasting impact can't be understated. The classic launched Disney as the animation giant we know today while being the first feature-length animated feature in film history. It's also an immensely charming, simple, yet incredible delight that earned its legacy and then some. It's a shame that Adriana Caselotti, the titular Snow White, was uncredited in this and her other roles. Her name deserves to be associated with the character for her legendary and unforgettable performance. I'd highly recommend seeing it in favor of this occasionally colorful yet predictably dull and extremely tedious extravaganza.

Let me get the positives out of the way so I don't forget to mention them.

First, the CGI was stunning. There were no poor moments of CGI, and the dwarfs weren't as distracting as I thought they'd be.

Next, two songs were catchy and easily the best of the entire film, one original and one from the 1937 version. The ""Heigh-Ho"" sequence is translated wonderfully into live-action, with slightly different lyrics and an enormous mine setting to play with. The only close to the magnificent original song, despite not having the same visual flare and advantage as ""Heigh-Ho,"" is ""Waiting On A Wish."" I thought Rachel Zegler's vocal delivery and the instrumentals go a long way to making the song memorable and very catchy.

Finally, if not ironically, while the writing doesn't do her character any favors, Rachel Zegler delivers a strong performance as Snow White. Zegler never ceases to be powerful, especially in the singing department.

Unfortunately and intensely frustratingly, those three positives can't even come close to saving the increasingly abundant flaws throughout the entire experience.

Primarily, Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay doesn't give any character that much to do. Snow White is the closest to having any depth, thanks to Zegler, but the rest of the characters are painfully forgettable. Additionally, Wilson's work relies on filler rather than anything meaningful. I'm sure she's talented, but none of her talent is present here.

Said script doesn't make the 1-hour and 49-minute runtime any less woeful. Fine momentum shows itself exclusively within the first forty minutes but then loses itself in the filler. About thirty minutes before its dissatisfying ending, my main desire was to leave. ""Snow White"" is the second film this year where I've had that feeling.

Speaking of which, the ending is plain bad. It strays heavily from the original for the worse, with a stupid final confrontation between Snow White and the Evil Queen. My only spark of misplaced hope once the boredom set in was for the finale to be entertaining, but it wasn't.

Although ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Waiting On A Wish"" were enjoyable songs, the rest ranged from forgettable to terrible. They only brought ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work"" over from the original, the latter being a disappointing re-do. The rest were new compositions, and they're all bland. The two that stand out as particularly awful are ""All Is Fair"" and ""Princess Problems."" I'll return to ""All Is Fair"" in a second, but ""Princess Problems"" was one of the worst songs I've heard in film. No offense to Zegler and Andrew Burnap, but their vocal delivery can't save a piece that nobody will listen to outside of watching this film - if this review hasn't convinced you to skip it yet.

Following this, Gal Gadot was unsurprisingly miscast as the Evil Queen. She's by all accounts a talented actress, so it amazes me how, regardless of the evident fun she's having playing the part, none of that charisma or energy translates to the screen. Furthermore, while she tries, her singing is not up to par with the rest of the game cast, in my opinion. Gadot's underwhelming vocal delivery let down ""All Is Fair"" and its reprise to an unbelievable degree. I hate being this harsh to her performance, and I like her as an actress, but this was not a project that gave her much to work with.

Lastly, where's the Disney magic? I haven't seen it for years. I want it back! None of the new characters were charming, while they removed one of my favorite aspects from the 1937 original: the emphasis on the animal's expressions. The tortoise only gets one close-up shot in the entire thing, while Snow White doesn't interact with any animal outside of the first fifteen minutes. The scene where the animals guide Snow White to the dwarves' home is dialogue-free here, and the seven lack charm past their first meeting with Snow White. These scenes wouldn't been better left unchanged, at the very least. It's a Disney live-action remake; it's what they could've done!

Overall, as much as I don't want to agree with this statement, ""Snow White"" was doomed to fail. My hope that it'd be startlingly decent, even great, was squandered by the film's execution. I thought ""Mufasa: The Lion King"" was far from horrible, but this remake is the best sign that Disney should stop making these live-action remakes. They won't quit because they make money either way. I want ""Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning"" to pull through and make more than ""Lilo & Stitch,"" which opens the same weekend, but the track record indicates the next potential Barbenheimer. Whatever: families will likely pay to see it, while moviegoers and critics like me question why they wasted their time. Now that my opinion is massive dislike, the best reason is to review it.

Technically, the screenplay, the acting, and the music underdeliver. However, the CGI, Marc Webb's okay directing, and Mandy Walker's inconsistent yet sometimes beautiful cinematography make the technical score a 7/10, and I'm a bit too generous with that score.

The enjoyment score is a far cry from the technical score. It may differ depending on who you are, but as a person who often watches films and likes not to be begging for one to end, by default, this is the worst movie I have gone to the theaters for yet. Younger audiences will have the highest chance of getting, at the very least, a 7/10 experience, but I can't say anyone outside of that group will have the same luxury. For me, the enjoyment score is a 3/10. It was astonishingly monotonous, and you should try to avoid it. If you want a song to listen to, catch ""Waiting On A Wish"" on Amazon, Apple, or Spotify. If you're curious, wait until Disney+. If you have no choice, bring coffee or watch ""The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie"" instead. It's the least you can do for yourself.",-/10
"Disney's 2025 live-action adaptation of ""Snow White,"" directed by Marc Webb, offers a fresh take on the classic tale, blending nostalgia with contemporary storytelling. Rachel Zegler shines in the titular role, embodying Snow White's innocence and strength with a captivating performance that breathes new life into the character. Opposite her, Gal Gadot delivers a compelling portrayal of the Evil Queen, exuding a chilling elegance that adds depth to the iconic villain.

The film introduces Andrew Burnap as Jonathan, a new character who serves as Snow White's ally and love interest. Burnap's chemistry with Zegler brings warmth and authenticity to their evolving relationship, providing a modern twist to the traditional narrative. The Seven Dwarfs are reimagined with a blend of voice acting and motion capture, featuring talents like Jeremy Swift (Doc), Tituss Burgess (Bashful), and Andrew Barth Feldman (Dopey), among others. This approach offers a unique visual representation, though it has sparked discussions regarding the use of CGI over practical casting.

Musically, the film balances classic melodies such as ""Whistle While You Work"" with new compositions by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Notably, the duet ""Princess Problems"" between Snow White and Jonathan stands out, reflecting their differing worldviews and adding depth to their characters. Visually, the movie enchants with lush landscapes and intricate set designs that immerse the audience in a fantastical realm.

However, the film is not without its critiques. Some viewers feel that the reliance on CGI for the dwarfs diminishes their charm, and certain modern updates may not resonate with all fans of the original. Despite these points, ""Snow White"" succeeds in delivering a heartfelt and visually stunning experience, honoring the legacy of the original while introducing thoughtful updates for a new generation.

In summary, ""Snow White"" (2025) stands as a testament to Disney's ability to reimagine its classics, offering a film that is both familiar and refreshingly new. With standout performances from Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, it invites audiences to revisit a beloved story through a contemporary lens.",8/10
"I think we're too hard on movies sometimes. I've even jumped on the bandwagon of criticism with the rest of the public for Snow White. But in all honesty, I thought it's a joyful beautiful tale full of Disney whimsy. Snow White has a very simple storyline and while I think there was some missed opportunity to make the storyline richer or more complex, some deeper dialogue even, I thought it did a good job of honouring the original tale with some simple additions. It was beautiful, musical and entertaining. Dwarfs were adorable, forest enchanting, characters played well. So enjoy the escape and be transported, leave the cruel criticism at the door.",7/10
"I had high hopes for Snow White, but unfortunately, it was a major disappointment. The original Disney film was full of heart, charm, and magic-none of which made it into this dull and uninspired remake.

The acting was lackluster, with performances that felt forced and devoid of emotion. The lead actress failed to capture the warmth and innocence that made the original Snow White so beloved. Instead of feeling enchanted by the story, I found myself completely disconnected from the characters.

Beyond the acting, the film itself lacked the wonder and whimsy that made the classic so special. The visuals were uninspired, and the attempts to modernize the story only stripped it of its charm. Rather than bringing fresh life to a beloved tale, this remake felt like a soulless cash grab.

If you're hoping for a nostalgic trip back to the magic of Snow White, this movie will only leave you disappointed. Save your time and rewatch the original instead.",1/10
"All I have to say is I wish Disney could refund my ticket and also pay me for the 2 hours I sat in this movie. The previews of other movies were more interesting.

Originality 0. Nothing new here it's a remake and a bad one at that.

Story 1. A story that doesn't really know where it's going at time. I wish I knew where the writing was at in their thoughts? It seems like they were trying more or less to write with a point in mind then to recapture the magic of the original Grimm or Disney tale.

Effects. 1 The effects in this movie are poor. When the first snow white released it was ahead of it's time.

Costumes 1 I think Disney bought these costumes from Party City before they went bankrupt.

Music. 4 it's ok the singing is decent

Acting. 3 Gal Gadot is wearing the crown for a reason. Her performance is only thing that keeps this moving on point. She is a pretty and wicked queen. Rachel Zegler has her moments but they are few and far between. Most of the movie she seems to be forced in the plot because she is snow white. Very out of place. Ansu Kabia as the huntsman is not to scary and sometimes he's present in the movie with no presence. The dwarves are CGI so nothing good can come from that performance. This movie really needed live action dwarves. What's wrong with portraying dwarves as hard working, caring, and protective? Not even going to mention the prince because in this version he is inconsequential.",1/10
"Another hollowed out remake with an unsettling look and feel. Terrible casting for Snow White and the writing was less than amazing for another Disney flop. Worst movie I've ever seen. Can't believe I wasted 109 minutes of my life on this crap. This is the worst adaptation I've seen.

This movie wasn't as bad as everyone has been saying it was going to be. Actually, it was much, much worse. Save some money, pop-in the original version DVD (or VHS) and enjoy the real Snow White and the wonderful story it is. How can you fumble such an easy win like this? It's over the top and unnatural in all the worse ways feasible.

Making SNOW WHITE brown and making the dwarfs look like PS1 Hagrid were all bold choices indeed.

If I saw this movie on a plane, I would still walk out...",1/10
"What the hell was Disney thinking making this bad CGI infested, soulless putrid mess of a movie? It is a disjointed mess of reshoots over reshoots and unfinished storylines. Don't bother wasting your time and hard earned money for this. You can go watch the original or you can stare at a wall for 2 hours and get better results. I am still having nightmares from seeing the seven CGI monstrosities out and about. The only saving grace for this waste of resources and tax write-off is that Rachel can actually sing her songs well. Gal's performance was terrible, didn't get where she was hoping for 1/10.",1/10
"Disney's latest Snow White movie leaves behind a sense of disappointment, particularly for fans of the original 1937 animated film. The magical, Bavarian elements of the classic film, such as Snow White's traditional dirndl dress, the castle that resembles Neuschwanstein, the Black Forest setting, the Bavarian wood carvings in the dwarfs' cottage are all missing in the new adaptation. Even the Evil Queen's potion glass, a Bavarian wine glass in the original, was part of the charm that connected the film to its Southern German roots. The Yodel Song was also drastically shortened in the new film. This cultural richness contributed to the original's charm, and its absence makes the new version feel ""hollow.""

Gal Gadot has a strong presence in the film, but the brief and not-scary transformation scene of the Evil Queen was a letdown, as it was one of the standout moments in the animated film.

The reason I'm giving this a 2 instead of a 1 is that the new soundtrack is actually pretty catchy. Still, even though the new film has some redeeming qualities, it overall fails to capture the magic, atmosphere, and rich German cultural elements that made the 1937 movie so beloved.",2/10
"The live-action Snow White remake disappoints, largely due to Rachel Zegler's lackluster portrayal of the iconic princess. Zegler's Snow White lacks the warmth and charm of the 1937 original, coming off as stiff and emotionally flat. Her attempt to modernize the character with an empowered edge feels forced and unnatural, while her singing, though technically strong, lacks soul and fails to elevate the forgettable new songs. Zegler's chemistry with co-stars, including Andrew Burnap's Jonathan and the CGI dwarfs, is weak, further isolating her performance. Overall, her disengaged portrayal contributes significantly to the film's failure to recapture the magic of the classic fairy tale.",1/10
"I'm a longtime Disney fan, even live next to Walt Disney World. But Snow White is just awful. The acting is terrible and the scene and CGI seems really cheaply done. I never thought would root for the apple, but Snow White is just so bad, it would have been better to have put her out of her misery.

The evil queen is much more attractive and doesn't make sense that she would even be remotely envious of the actress who plays Snow White. My son was bored and said they could have used any of the Snow White characters from the theme parks to use instead of this actress. Why does Disney keep ruining every classic they remake?",1/10
"It's hard to come up with words to describe what a total let down this steaming piece of garbage is. Yet another pointless remake made because Hollywood has zero, absolutely no creativity or originality. Seriously you have to go to the low budget arena to see anything worth while.

The main problem with this movie is the acting. Gal Gadont watch my movies can't act her way out of a wet paper bag with help from craft service. Seriously she's that bad. And Rachel just exudes this low rent hate that poisons the movie. Seriously bad energy even for a joke of a production like this. Watch the original. Walt knew what he was doing.",1/10

"I feel like a lot of people just want to hate this movie, but if you can forgo all the politics and behind the scenes drama you may actually find it to be a very magical retelling of a Disney classic. It is a familiar story, but not the same story. I think they improved upon the original. The dwarves were delightfully cute and funny with Dopey of course being the stand out! The romance is able to build between Snow White and her ""Prince"" and the music featured some great new songs as well as the original songs. I went in with low expectations only because of all the bad press, but i was incredibly surprised! The theater full of people applauded at the end of the film and by everyone's reactions during the movie I know that most everyone enjoyed the movie as much as I did.",8/10

"I went to see the movie with my girlfriend. She was stoked to see it and I enjoyed the original from when I was a kid, so I said sure why not. I had heard some things but like a lot of movies these days if you don't want to be spooled you don't look up stuff, so I chose not to look up anything so I could be surprised when I saw it with her. This movie is so terribly bad that if it wasn't for the fact I was there with someone I would have requested a refund. My girlfriend's though was let's give it 5 more minutes and see where it goes and eventually we get to the end and even she was disappointed. You're better off watching the trailer and even then that's pushing it.",1/10
"Terribly casted, who could not capture each of their respective characters, painfully boring, Gal Gadot's performance as an evil queen was as bad as her accent which outdid her acting. CGI of the seven dwarfs did not capture the original characters imagery. To compare it to the original would be a grave mistake. Felt like the movie in whole tried soo hard to be better than the original, and lost it's core.

A torture to watch and it's not even of a horror genre.

Watching paint dry could be potentially as enjoyable. A complete waste of time and money.

All in all a massive fail as a live action remake. Avoid watching this movie.",1/10
"I've always been a huge fan of Disney movies - their magic, music, and memorable characters have been a part of my life since childhood. So when I sat down to watch this film, I was genuinely excited and hopeful. Unfortunately, that excitement quickly turned into disappointment, and by the end, I was left in complete disbelief.

This was, without a doubt, the worst Disney film I have ever seen. The storyline lacked heart, the pacing was off, and the emotional core that usually defines a Disney movie was nowhere to be found. But the most shocking part of all was Gal Gadot's performance. Her acting was stiff and unconvincing, completely devoid of the warmth or depth that the character required. It was painfully clear that she was miscast, and her presence only dragged the film further down.

What makes it worse is the fact that this movie tried to build on a beloved original - and failed miserably. Instead of honoring what made the original special, it felt like a hollow imitation, filled with glossy visuals but no soul. It was not just a letdown - it was almost offensive to fans who hold the original dear.

If it were possible to give a negative rating, I wouldn't hesitate. Watching this movie felt like a waste of time, and I genuinely regret pressing play. My advice? Spare yourself the disappointment. Skip this one entirely.",1/10
"Didn't like the mixture of actors and animation and the storyline wasn't good and not impressed with Rachel Zegler performance, didn't think she was trying. I thought Hal Gadot was awesome and did a fantastic job, she really impressed me.

Didn't like the dwarves and how they looked. I know that's they are just characters but they were to cartoony and their personalities were not like the biome i read as a kid. I wish they would have been more realistic and they used real actors not the cgi stuff they use all the time, very disappointing if you ask me. I wish they would have used Tim Burton.......",1/10
"When the Queen looks at her magic mirror it clearly is faulty and probably delivered from a cheap knock-off from the real thing.

Gal Gadot is a goddess in every sense a beautiful woman, who should have no issues getting jealous of another woman's looks.

Rachel Zegler is just average, not someone I'd crawl over broken glass with my flies open to try and bag a kiss from.

Here the fundamental flaws in the films logic are laid bare, Rachel can sing .. but that's about it.

The film after its disastrous reshoots which meant it was delayed for over a year, it manages to shoehorn in some horrendous cgi dwarves along with bandits ???. Bandits ????, now forgive me but I do not recall these being in the original. It's pretty evident that these were the original magical beings or poor substitutes for the dwarves and the film couldn't structurally exist without them due to the footage that had already been filmed.

The film follows certain beats from the original initially before deciding it wants to be something else, and the mediocre songs do not help either.

You also know there's a massive issue with the film when they've literally dropped the 'Seven Dwarfs' from the title and simply called it 'Snow White'. The holy grail of the Disney legacy is subsequently crucified in the name of a modern re-invention of the classic and believe me I am furious that Disney didn't have the respect for the original and hired an actress in the lead who has nothing but contempt for it. Rachel has made that clear from her big mouth in numerous press junkets where they let her open it.

This film is exhaustedly terrible and has no right to exist.",1/10
"I can't even begin to express how infuriated I am after watching the latest adaptation of Snow White. This movie is an absolute travesty that fails on every level!

Instead of celebrating the traditional elements that made Snow White beloved for generations, the filmmakers decided to completely alter the character dynamics in an attempt to be ""progressive."" Newsflash: changing the essence of characters just for the sake of social commentary does NOT equal good storytelling!

Snow White herself feels more like a caricature than a character. She's portrayed as a rebellious teenager, full of angst, and completely dismisses the charm that made her story enchanting. The whimsical love story is reduced to a tired trope of ""I don't need a prince,"" diminishing the emotional core of the original tale. It's like they set out to remove every ounce of magic in favor of some misguided notion of empowerment.

And let's talk about the dwarfs. They've been re-imagined in a way that's not only ridiculous but also insulting. Instead of being endearing side characters, they come off as a jumbled mess of stereotypes with zero development. Their jokes fall flat, and it's clear that the writers were more focused on pseudo humor than crafting an engaging narrative.

The plot twists are not only predictable but also devoid of any real stakes. By the time we got to the climax, I found myself rolling my eyes rather than feeling any tension or excitement.

And the ending? Don't even get me started! It's a slap in the face to anyone who cherishes the original story.

If you're looking for the magic and wonder that Snow White used to bring, you won't find it here. This adaptation has completely misunderstood the heart of the story.

Save your time and money-this is not the Snow White you've been hoping for!",1/10
"I genuinely tried to watch Snow White objectively-open-minded, no nostalgia goggles, just a clean slate. And I was honestly shocked by how bad this movie was.

The pacing is awkward, the plot feels paper-thin, and the characters are so underdeveloped it's almost insulting. Snow White herself is less of a protagonist and more of a decorative object being moved around the story with zero agency. It's hard to root for someone who barely seems aware of what's happening around her.

The humor doesn't land, the dialogue is painfully simplistic, and the dwarfs-while iconic in name-are just cartoonish stereotypes with no real depth. I understand this was a product of its time, but that doesn't excuse how flat and dull everything feels. Even the villain, who should be a highlight, is reduced to melodramatic overacting and weak motivations.

Visually, it's dated-which is expected-but even so, the animation doesn't hold up in a way that compensates for the movie's many flaws. I wasn't expecting Pixar-level polish, but I was hoping for at least some sense of magic or charm. Instead, it felt like a chore to get through.

If this is considered a classic, it's only because of historical significance-not quality. Snow White is, unfortunately, a relic that hasn't aged well, and watching it today only highlights how far storytelling and animation have come. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who values plot, character development, or emotional depth.",1/10
"Ah yes, Snow White (2024)-a film that bravely asks, ""What if we took a timeless classic and made it aggressively unlikable?"" My personal favorite part? When Snow White girlbossed the dwarfs into doing chores for her. In the original, she lovingly said, ""And I will use the broom."" But in this one? Nope. It's ""And HE will use the broom."" Nothing says empowerment like delegating housework to a group of hardworking men who were minding their own business. Truly inspiring.

But wait-why stop at ruining the dwarfs when you can also add seven completely pointless bandits? That's right, we got dwarfs AND bandits, and yet somehow, the film had double the characters and half the charm. These bandits were about as necessary as a glass slipper at a marathon. Seriously, why were they there? What was their purpose? Did they get lost on their way to a Robin Hood audition?

I physically walked out of this movie. Not metaphorically, not emotionally-I stood up and left. And honestly? I think even the Prince wanted out.

Rachel Zegler: ""I don't need a Prince to save me."" The Prince: ""Good, because I'm actually here for your stepmother.""

And can we please stop pretending that bad writing is excusable because ""it's for kids""? Children deserve good movies, not whatever this was. If you genuinely believe kids are too dumb to appreciate quality storytelling, I'd love to introduce you to Pixar, Harry Potter, and literally any Studio Ghibli film.

Final verdict: The Evil Queen was right. Snow White does need to be stopped.",1/10
"The actress and the movie were actually good; however, the casting director failed to select the right people to complete the ensemble. While the film had potential, its execution suffered due to casting choices that didn't align well with the characters or the storyline. A well chosen cast plays a crucial role in elevating a movie, bringing characters to life in a way that feels authentic and emotionally engaging. Unfortunately, in this case, the supporting cast fell short, which impacted the overall viewing experience.

A great movie is not just about a strong lead performance. While the actress did an excellent job, delivering a compelling and convincing portrayal of her character, the supporting actors failed to bring the same level of depth and believability. This lack of cohesion among the cast members can make a movie feel disjointed and prevent audiences from fully immersing themselves in the story. Even with a well-written script and solid direction, weak casting choices can create an imbalance that makes it harder for viewers to connect with the film on a deeper level. Casting is an art that requires a keen eye for talent, chemistry, and suitability. A casting director's job is to ensure that each actor embodies their character in a way that enhances the film's vision. When this process is not handled with precision, it can result in performances that feel forced, awkward, or unconvincing. This is particularly true in films where character relationships play a significant role in the storytelling. If the chemistry between characters doesn't feel natural, it can make even the best-written dialogue fall flat.",-/10
"I'm going to be completely honest - I didn't love it. In fact, I think Disney has well and truly lost its way. And before anyone jumps to the usual debates about casting or politics, that's not even the real issue here. The real problem is that these live-action remakes have become utterly soulless. They're missing the heart, the wonder, the sheer magic that made the originals so special.

'Snow White' should feel like a fairytale, something enchanting and timeless, but instead, this just felt... flat. The visuals were fine, the acting was actually decent, and the reimagining of the dwarfs (or ""magical companions"") wasn't as bad as I'd feared. But it all felt like a box-ticking exercise rather than a film made with love or passion.

Disney keeps trying to modernise these classics, but they seem to have forgotten why people fell in love with them in the first place. I wanted to be swept away, to feel that childhood excitement again, but instead, I was just checking my watch. It's not the worst thing they've done, but it's yet another reminder that the Disney of today isn't what it used to be.",6/10
"This might just be the worst Disney live-action remake ever. The script is a total disaster-nothing makes sense, and it honestly feels like they were rewriting scenes on the spot without any real direction. The pacing is all over the place, the dialogue is cringey, and the whole thing feels like a rushed, half-baked mess.

Not a single moment in this Snow White feels engaging. It's not just that the lead actress seems totally miscast-the entire movie is filled with forced, unrealistic moments that completely pull you out of the story. Instead of creating something magical or meaningful, they shove in so many unnecessary changes and heavy-handed messaging that it's just exhausting to sit through. The balance between updating the story and keeping the heart of the original is completely off, making it feel more like a lecture than an actual movie.

Nothing flows naturally, and the lack of coherence makes it hard to care about anything happening on screen. The forced attempts to be modern feel incredibly awkward, and rather than feeling progressive or fresh, it just comes off as hollow and unnatural. It's hard to feel invested when everything feels like it was thrown together without much thought. In the end, this Snow White isn't just a disappointment-it's a complete misfire.",2/10
"The film's lack of cohesive storytelling and its failure to capture the magical essence associated with Disney classics. Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is described as unconvincing, with her portrayal lacking depth and charm. While her singing ability is acknowledged, her character comes across as overly passive and inconsistent. The Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot, is noted for her striking presence but is undermined by a script that fails to explore her motivations effectively.

Key plot points, such as Snow White's quest to find her father and the dynamics with the Seven Dwarfs, are riddled with inconsistencies and underdeveloped arcs. The narration by Dopey feels unnecessary and detracts from the story. Additionally, the film's tone awkwardly shifts between dark and whimsical, leaving viewers unsure of its intended audience.

Visually, the movie struggles to create an immersive fantasy world, and its small-scale production design detracts from the grandeur expected in a Disney remake. Ultimately, the film is disappointing and has sloppy execution and missed opportunities to modernize the story meaningfully.",1/10
"I was waiting for the Prince. Which snow white adaptation is this ? Is there some thing wrong with the writers and directors. They Changed The whole Plot Of the Movie to convert it into utter trash.

"This latest live-action remake of Snow White is a disjointed and uninspired adaptation that fails to capture the magic of the original. Rachel Zegler delivers a commendable performance as Snow White, but her efforts are undermined by a convoluted script and lackluster direction. Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen lacks the menace and depth needed for such an iconic villain, resulting in a flat and unconvincing performance. The CGI-rendered dwarfs are unsettling and fall deep into the uncanny valley, making them more distracting than endearing. The film's over-reliance on computer-generated imagery extends to its environments, which feel artificial and lifeless, stripping away any sense of wonder. New musical numbers fail to leave an impression, paling in comparison to the timeless classics. Overall, this remake feels like a soulless cash grab, lacking the charm and heart that made the original a beloved masterpiece.........",1/10
"Disney has officially lost the plot. This abomination of a film is not just bad-it's an insult to storytelling, filmmaking, and anyone who grew up loving the original Snow White. I sat through nearly two hours of this disaster, hoping it would redeem itself, but no. It only got worse.

The visuals? A soulless, CGI-infested nightmare. The costumes? Laughably cheap. The acting? Gal Gadot tries, but even she can't save this wreck. And Snow White herself? The absolute worst casting choice imaginable-zero charisma, zero charm, zero presence.

The dwarves? Oh wait, never mind-they barely exist. The script? Lifeless and preachy. The magic? Completely absent. This isn't just a failure-it's a mockery of the classic fairytale.

Disney, what have you done? You took something timeless and turned it into a steaming pile of corporate garbage. If this is the future of Disney live-action remakes, I want no part of it.",1/10
Well movies have been bad lately :( Disney and marvel and everything now is just low effort they either using AI for the editor writing or they simply don't care about the movie they just think that they are a big corporation and everything they produced will be shoved into our mouths and we will consume it which I'm impressed with like the new captain America that they can actually sell that many millions but eventually either ruining the experience for us and for them.

"Fond memory of this film growing up. Imagine my shock and horror watching this film and seeing it has been ruined. Once again Disney has submitted to the 1% and ignored the rest of their fan base.

With a different name and slightly different story it would have been another great Disney film. Instead they've decided to use the successful name of ""Snow White"", butcher it and repackage it as a remake. It isn't. This should have been a different film altogether. New name, new characters etc. I would have probably liked this film.

If you are planning on watching this film because you like the originals, don't.

"This movie is horrible. It has no heart, no soul and far too much Rachel Zegler. It has no magical beauty to it. It's flat and boring. And the CGI dwarves are atrocious and look hurried. They try so hard to force the viewer to love this terribly-acted princess and the path she's on in her story. They failed their fans, but Disney doesn't seem to care about it's fans anymore anyway. It's time to move on to new content and stop digging up and ruining the nostalgia for all of the fans they're attempting to milk every last dollar from. It's getting old and destroying the beloved messages of their old projects.",1/10
"Lily Collin's also leads a revolt but she's very watchable. This is a bad B grade ripoff lacking Lily and Julia Robert's to make it notable.

I don't know what I was expecting. I lived Gkass Slipper and Maleficent. I loved Beauty and the Beast. No shade in live action. It's just that this Sniw White is horribly cast and doesn't even pay cursory respect to the wonderful original.

Finally - we see you Disney. Finishing with a White Party at the end. Nobody is asking you to be boring, or slavish to tradition. But I think we are asking you to not insult our intelligence or create something so ""modern"" and ideological that it's not a fairy tale for the princess OR the audience.",1/10

The negatives: everything else. The set, the visuals, the costumes, the creepy dwarves, the dialogue, the CGI, Gal's acting (if you call that acting), the general direction of the story and the plot.

This good thing about this was Rachel Zelgers voice, it's great. But her acting was, childish and flat. Not sure how she got the main role, maybe if it was a cartoon her voice would work but not in a Disney feature film.

Every time I tried to get into it, her lack of charisma and acting skills dragged it back down again, to more like a bad B movie. I would not recommend.

"I can barely compose myself right now. The joy I had while watching Snow White is something I can't remember experiencing before. Everything about this movie is perfect. It doesn't force a weird love story. Snow White is so much more beautiful than the Evil Queen. The only hiccup is all the dwarfs are white!

Speaking of the dwarfs, I went into this movie without knowing anything. I was SHOCKED to discover afterwards the dwarfs were (and still are) CGI! They look so real and lifelike, like Yoda from Star Wars.

I can only imagine how foolish Hollywood feels for having its Oscar ceremony before Snow White was released, because clearly it would have won every category!

I can't wait to see it again and blink at different moments than I blinked the first time, to ensure I don't miss any of the magic.",-/10
"It appears that Snow White 2025 can't even escape the apparent IMDb manipulation by bots to dramatically drive down its ratings and the Israeli-Palestinian controversy and casting Rachel Zegler whose American father and Columbian mother creating a ""non-white"" character backlash. Even with these controversies aside it is hard not to ignore the current political divide for those aware of the emotional turmoil besetting the United States and the plotline of the movie as dramatically displayed on screen. Nevertheless in sending these non-cinematic concerns to the backseat, this movie has its rich musical, lyrical charm, strong singing numbers, and a harder dramatic edge that even appears to have some young children captivated. There is plenty of wry humor, timely musical numbers, and good pacing except for a moment in the middle of the movie and one musical number that could easily have been edited out. The underlying message of cooperation, fairness, and kindness, and, yes, getting along with others from all walks of life form a backbone of this movie in the form of Rachel Zegler as the titular Snow White. Gal Gadot also offers up a strong evil character with her own snazzy musical piece and performance as the wicked stepmother and sometimes creepy, appealing hag. In sum, Snow White 2025 is definitely worth viewing, a movie that brings a vibrant freshness to live action animation.",8/10

"I usually try to find something redeemable in every film I watch, but with Snow White (2025), that task proved nearly impossible. This film is a complete misfire, both in terms of storytelling and execution, and honestly, I'm still wondering how it even got greenlit in its current form.

Let's start with the obvious: this is not Snow White. It's a hollow reimagining that strips away everything that made the original timeless. Gone is the heartwarming charm, the sense of wonder, and the emotional core. What we're left with is a preachy, politically charged narrative that seems more focused on pushing an agenda than telling a compelling story.

The lead performance lacks charisma and warmth. Snow White, once a symbol of kindness and innocence, is now cold, defiant, and unrelatable. While reinterpreting characters can work when done with care, here it feels forced and out of sync with the tone of the story. Supporting characters - including the dwarfs (sorry, ""magical companions"") - are either underdeveloped or completely unnecessary. The chemistry between characters is nonexistent, and many scenes drag without purpose.

Visually, the film is uninspired. The CGI looks cheap at times, and the costume design feels like it was ripped from a high school theater production. Even the forest - usually a place of magic and mystery - feels sterile and lifeless.

I'm all for updating classics and making them resonate with new generations, but it has to be done with respect and care. This version of Snow White feels like it was written by committee, afraid to commit to a clear vision and desperate to tick all the ""modernization"" boxes.

Disney has proven it can make successful live-action remakes (Cinderella, The Jungle Book), but this isn't one of them. It's not even close. If you're a fan of the original, I strongly advise skipping this one. It will only leave you frustrated, disappointed, and wondering why some stories can't just be left alone.",1/10
Disjointed scenes and too many songs. Some of the songs were good but there were definitely ones that were not needed. Wished there was more acting. The costumes were not matching. I liked how the dwarfs looked but I wished we heard more from them. The Prince was almost non existent so an opportunity for a good love story was missed. I wish the Godmother was less cartoonish. Snow White was maybe a bit too modern for the setting. They should have either changed the settings or should have made Snow White match the times. Disappointed for ruining such a classic. I expected the quality I saw from the Lion King or Alladin remake.,2/10
"A complete failure on Disney's part. Setting aside the promo failures of Rachel and her PR team, this was probably one of the biggest losses Disney has suffered in recent memory. The movie felt as though the planning and writing were half baked and poorly executed. With story lines that seemed like they were cobbled together from other Disney movies, it was hard to tell if you were watching a partial remake of Rapunzel or some other princess. The script was lacking in 'new' Disney magic. With the biggest name on the screen being Gal Gadot, and her character being one of the Disney villain icons, Disney-goers would've expected a looming, strong, devious, and quietly cunning witch. But instead gets a loud bejeweled version of walking Ursula. The score was uninteresting and not memorable. The songs were repetitive and did not flow consistently with the theme of the overall vision. Visually, the CGI was predictable and unimaginative.",1/10
"This live action remake of Snow White is nothing like the original Snow White movie, they put a bunch of new songs in there that sucked and they even changed most of the lyrics to the original songs. The plot was different in many ways and there is no prince Florian, just a bandit named Jonathan. Both actresses were terrible in this movie and I even like Gal Gadot but it was a very poor casting decision. It felt like the movie unnecessarily dragged on halfway through and the ending was awful. I was so bored and just waiting for it to end. I had low expectations going into the movie and it was worse than that.",1/10
"This movie failed to capture my attention from start to finish.

The acting felt uninspired, and the storyline lacked cohesion, making it difficult to feel any emotional connection. While the dwarfs were entertaining at times, their presence still felt somewhat off.

The animation seemed low-quality, as if the budget wasn't used effectively. That said, the Mirror was an interesting character, and the thief had some redeeming moments.

It's disappointing because this had the potential to be great-especially considering Disney's success with Mufasa.

Overall, this movie was a disappointment and could have been done a lot better..",1/10
"It splits in the middle and feelsike two movies. Bad acting from gal Gadot. God singing form Rachel Ziegler but acting is very bad. The ears looked like creatures from hell the eyes have no souls, their movement is weird and Al around loo just didn't fit. Uninspired writing and a weak script make the story feel lifeless, draining any charm from the original. The CGI is unsettling, with the dwarfs looking unnatural and out of place. Scenes drag on without purpose, and the humor falls flat. Any attempt at emotional depth is ruined by awkward dialogue and poor direction. It lacks heart, energy, and visual appeal, making it a frustrating watch. Even nostalgia can't save it-this is a soulless, unnecessary remake that fails on almost every level.",1/10
"Well, basically-they fail on the basics.

What really caught me off guard was who ended up disappointing me the most. I went in expecting issues elsewhere, but surprisingly, it was Gal Gadot who stood out in all the wrong ways. I genuinely didn't expect her to be the weak link, but her performance felt undercooked and surprisingly rookie for someone of her experience. It lacked the depth and presence you'd hope for, especially given the iconic role she was playing.

Then there's the scenery-or rather, the lack of it. It felt lazy and uninspired, like they cut corners on the visuals that are supposed to give fairy tales their magic. The sets didn't pull you into the world; they pushed you out of it.

And don't even get me started on the costume design. It was oddly offbeat, almost like the characters were wearing outfits from a different movie entirely. The clothing lacked that timeless, fantastical charm and instead came across as cheap or hastily thrown together.

Overall, it just didn't click. It's disappointing when a classic like Snow White gets a retelling that misses the mark on all the fundamentals-acting, visuals, and atmosphere.",1/10
"Snow White film (2025) is an utter disaster that fails on every level. This film's misguided attempt to reimagine a beloved classic results in a chaotic, disjointed mess devoid of any magic. The storyline is convoluted and poorly paced, while the characters remain shallow and unconvincing. Lavish budgets are squandered on weak special effects and baffling casting decisions. What should have been a fresh, engaging reinterpretation is nothing more than a tiresome, uninspired rehash that leaves audiences frustrated and disillusioned. A total waste of time and money that insults true cinematic art. Ugh.",-/10
"Snowwhite isn't as bad as people say. While it has its flaws, it also has a lot to offer. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the fairy-tale world with breathtaking visuals, and the score adds to the film's enchanting yet eerie atmosphere. The plot may be predictable at times, but the lead performance is strong, carrying the emotional weight of the story. Some of the dialogue feels clunky, and the pacing drags in parts, but there are genuinely magical moments that shine. Not a masterpiece, but certainly not the disaster some are making it out to be-it's a decent reimagining that deserves a fair chance.",10/10
"The new Snow White movie is an absolute mess, and Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is a major contributor to its downfall. Rather than delivering a menacing, commanding performance, Gadot's portrayal feels forced, as if she's reading lines without any genuine connection to her character. It's as though she believes just looking stern is enough to convince us she's evil, but the flat delivery and lack of depth only make her seem more like a confused villain than the sinister figure we're meant to fear. Her presence, instead of elevating the film, actually drags it down, making you wonder how such a talented actress could fall so short in such a pivotal role.

The character design, the dialogue, and the interactions feel disconnected and shallow, and Gadot doesn't help by underplaying what could've been a campy, exaggerated portrayal. It's not just bad-it's boring. Watching her attempt to hold her own against Snow White is like watching paint dry. If the Evil Queen is supposed to be a complex and captivating character, she's anything but here. The film is a testament to missed opportunities, and unfortunately, Gal Gadot's performance stands as a prime example of that.",1/10
"I thought Snow White was supposed to be attractive inside and out. Terrible choice to play the lead in this classic. Fair looking but nowhere close to beautiful or even pretty enough to align with the dynamic that a beautiful queen would be jealous of her. A rough mediocre personality comes through in her acting as well. Bad CGI. Absolute fail on Disneys part. Disney just needs to clean house and start over again. It's been one bad movie after another. You'd think with all of the money that Disney is losing in their films and at their theme parks, they would get rid of the toxic employees and start fresh.",1/10
"Snow White is the foundation of an Empire. This ""reimagining"" has cost Disney dearly. Hundreds of millions have gone into this project. The finished product is laughable at best. The only positive to come out of this debacle was Gal Gadot performance. Rachel Zegler's performance was forced and fell flat. The costumes and design was amateurish and felt like a low-budget indie film. The constant rewrites and shooting drove up the costs to the point that this was guaranteed to be a failure but one can only wonder how the House of Mouse could fumble a product with all their resources. The Rachel Zegler Press Tour was a complete disaster and I truly feel sorry for all the actors that suffered along the way. I think viewers can find a much better way to spend 1hr 49min of their life.",1/10
"I went into this movie hoping for a magical fairy tale, but instead, I got a budget cosplay convention with the charm of a wet sock. Snow White, the fairest of them all? More like the most unbothered of them all. I've seen more emotion from my Roomba when it gets stuck under the couch.

The dwarfs? Oh, sorry-the seven vaguely assembled individuals who may or may not be shorter than average. They had less chemistry than a high school dropout. The Evil Queen? I was low-key rooting for her. Prince Charming? He was so forgettable that I already forgot if he was even in the movie.

The CGI was so bad that I thought my screen had a virus. The dialogue? If you told me ChatGPT wrote it, I'd believe you. And the message of the movie? I think it was ""Don't expect too much from life, or from this movie.""

Save your money. If you want a real Snow White experience, just eat an apple and take a long nap instead.",1/10
"Honestly, this movie felt like a bland rehash of a story we've seen a hundred times. The characters were flat, the pacing dragged, and the ""modern twists"" just didn't land. Even the visuals, which could've saved it, were underwhelming. It's like they tried to reinvent the wheel and ended up with a triangle. Not worth the time.

Let's start with the characters. Snow White herself, played with little nuance, comes across more like a background character in her own story. She lacks the emotional depth or personality needed to carry the film, and unfortunately, the writing doesn't do her any favors either. The dialogue is stiff, forced, and at times painfully cringe-worthy, trying to sound modern and empowering but ending up awkward and shallow.

The Evil Queen, usually the highlight of any Snow White adaptation, is reduced here to a caricature. Her motivations are unclear, her presence is inconsistent, and the performance feels half-baked. It's hard to take her seriously when she flips between cartoonish villain and misunderstood anti-hero without any real development or justification. What could've been a complex antagonist ends up as one of the weakest parts of the movie.",1/10

"Disney's live-action remake of ""Snow White"" is a dismal failure that tarnishes the legacy of the beloved classic. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks the charm and innocence that defined the original character, leaving audiences disconnected and disappointed. The film's attempt to modernize the narrative results in a convoluted plot that strays too far from its source material, alienating longtime fans. Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen is equally underwhelming, failing to evoke the menace and allure essential to the role. The overuse of CGI, particularly in the depiction of the seven dwarfs, is jarring and detracts from the film's visual appeal. Moreover, the lackluster musical numbers are forgettable and fail to capture the magic of the original score. Overall, this remake is a soulless endeavor that offers nothing of value, leaving audiences yearning for the timeless charm of the 1937 classic.",1/10
"I honestly don't care who is what colour - we're over that now, it's been going on for years and it's never going to stop. Let it be. But a bad movie is a bad movie. This is awful beyond imagining. Everything about it screams ""Wicked"", But there can be only one Wicked (another lousy movie, but a wonderful musical). The desperation to recreate the musical palette of Wicked, and to build a fantasy world just like that musical did is embarrassing. The acting is (UK) lunchtime soap standard and the whole look of it is so fake and queasy you'd be advised not to eat before You see it. I don't go to the movies (and take my family, an expensive hobby) just so I can say ""told you so!"" - I had an open mind and really wanted to be wowed. I wasn't wowed, I was depressed. From the age of four, I don't remember Snow White ever having that effect on me before.",1/10
"I have no idea what movie y'all watched, but it definitely wasn't this one. Snow White should be a magical movie for anyone with even a molecule of joy left in their hearts. It elevates the original story and characters in ways I didn't think were possible while staying true to the essence of the 1937 film. Everything that people were complaining about without seeing the movie makes complete sense within the context of it.

My only complaint was Gal Gadot. Her performance was very inconsistent. It seemed like she didn't know how to play the Evil Queen and just kept throwing things at the wall. Unfortunately very little of it stuck. Her best scenes were as the old hag.",9/10
"Absolute disaster. Whoever cast this actress as Snow White should be fired immediately. She delivers every line with the emotional range of a cardboard cutout-wooden, lifeless, and painfully unconvincing. There's zero charm, zero magic, and absolutely nothing resembling the warmth and innocence that defines Snow White.

Her performance is so stiff, it's like watching a first-year drama student struggle through a middle school play. Disney has had some questionable casting choices over the years, but this one takes the poisoned apple. A complete butchering of a beloved character. Do yourself a favor and rewatch the 1937 animated classic instead-this live-action remake is a cursed mirror reflection of everything that went wrong. 0/10, would rather watch the Evil Queen's monologues on loop.",-/10
"Snow White, the latest in Disney's line of uninspiring remakes, is an effort that slightly surpassed my expectations. Not something I think will be fondly remembered, but the vitriol in reaction to its existence seems especially unearned.

The writing is quite average, but I appreciate that it tries a somewhat fresh take. While not diverging too much from the basic narrative of the 1937 film, it tries to add depth to Snow White and the substitute Prince character and extends the runtime by some other means. Not groundbreaking, but I at least felt like I was watching an actual re-adaptation of the source material instead of just a CGI'd up live action rendition of the original movie. Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella was one where it stuck very close to the original while barely adding anything of substance, making it feel hollow despite very nice filmmaking. Sure, I'd say it's a better overall film than this Snow White, but the latter is the format I would prefer a remake to follow.

The technical aspects of the movie could have been improved upon. The cinematography and color grading do very little to make it a visually exciting experience although nothing was distractingly bad. The visual effects, however, were distracting. The animals take on a cartoonish appearance but that only serves to make them look fake the entire time. The dwarfs are the worst offender; their designs are just unappealing and there's a degree of uncomfortability every time they're on screen, especially Dopey. The ""Heigh-Ho"" sequence, which is likely 100% CGI, is probably the worst part of the movie. Making the dwarfs live action would probably have made the movie overall more palatable.

The music is solidly executed. It does away with a large part of the music from the 1937 film, and the new songs are alright. I think I would've preferred the music to sound ""bigger"", and there is some noticeable autotune, but I found this movie to definitely handle music better than some of the other remakes.

Snow White is just another Disney remake but I found it justifies its existence more than some others in the lineup. I've seen almost all of the recent ones and I definitely prefer the likes of Pete's Dragon and Dumbo to Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. Snow White isn't particularly impressive, but it did hold my attention and my impression was overall positive despite some hiccups.",6/10
"In a stunning display of cinematic ineptitude, the 2025 remake of Snow White proves that not every classic fairy tale deserves a modern reimagining. This film is less a magical journey and more a painful exercise in how to completely butcher a beloved story.

The screenplay reads like it was written by a committee of disinterested marketing executives who once heard someone describe Snow White in passing. Our titular character, played with all the charisma of a department store mannequin, stumbles through a plot so convoluted that even the seven dwarfs would struggle to make sense of it.

The visual effects are a catastrophe that would make even low-budget YouTube creators cringe. The enchanted forest looks like it was constructed using a combination of stock footage and a toddler's finger paintings. The evil queen's transformation scenes are so poorly executed that they appear to have been rendered on a smartphone from 2010.

Dialogue reaches new heights of cringe-worthiness, with lines so wooden they could be used as lumber in home construction. Characters deliver exposition with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination. Every potentially interesting moment is crushed under the weight of unnecessary plot twists and painfully forced attempts at ""modernizing"" the classic tale.

The musical numbers - if one can even call them that - sound like they were composed during a particularly uninspired karaoke night. Auto-tune is weaponized to such an extent that it becomes a form of auditory assault.

Perhaps the most offensive aspect of this film is how it manages to strip away every ounce of magic from a story that has enchanted generations. This isn't a reimagining; it's a total dismemberment of a classic fairy tale.

Save your money, save your time, and most importantly, save your sanity. This Snow White doesn't just fail to wake up from a magical slumber - it puts the entire audience into a coma of boredom.",1/10
"I barely write reviews but this ones deserves one so that never do hopefully others dont have to go through a cringe fest like this. My wife slept within 30 minsm I within an hour and we couldnt really believe how they ruined a disney classic! Like how do you get everything wrong from casting to execution of a simple storyline to acting! The main lead actress barely has the presence for someone playing snow white and what was Gal Gadot doing as the evil queen! Her acting is almost comical and in some scenes I was laughing at the sheer absurdity of her dialogue delivery and expressions. She should stick to wonder woman or take some acting lessons from Charlize Theron (the other snow white and huntsman movie). Also the pace of the movie is super slow at times to the point of exhaustion vs fast paced in other important settings. Like the whole create poisoned apple, princess eats apple, guy escapes and kisses snowhite happens in less than 15 mins!! It has to be one of the worst disney movies ever created and deserving a ton of razzies! (especially Gal Gadot)",1/10
"This movie feels like it was wrote by people who hate the original, and acted by people who hate it more.

Its like a satire rip off that pokes fun at the original story and the people who liked it.

Everything looks fake, somehow faker that the animated original. Snow whites performance comes across as a mean girl pretending to be nice. I was hoping the evil queen would reveal that snow white is the evil queen in an interesting twist but there's nothing interesting about this movie. Quite sad how people at Disney hated the original story so much that they had to change it this much. Rest in peace disney, you were once loved and now you have stabbed us in the back and mocked us.",1/10
"The movie is really a waste of time to watch. I don't know why Disney is destroying all the amazing classics we grew up watching.

The story is changed. The characters are not convincing, they music in the movie is boring. I hope they rethink before remaking any other classics again. I loved watching snow white when I was a kid. We all loved the story with the morals in it and now we are confused. I have another idea, why they don't create a new characters and make the movie for them. At least they can create some characters that suit the actors not choosing some actors that ruin the whole story.",1/10
"This is a very sad review for me to write. I grew up with the original Disney classic animation films as a foundation or bedrock of my childhood. What I just saw would have Disney himself spinning in his grave. Everything about this movie is bad, but I have to say the performances of the main leads is really where it goes off the rails and into a sewer. Rachel Zegler might have talent, I don't know. But it certainly isn't clear from this film. She seemed an odd choice to play this role however. Gal Gadon't know how to act, on the other hand, this woman is bad. She can't act. I've seen her in half a dozen streamer films and it's the same schtick each time, and here we are again, the same schtick. She can't act, folks, it's as simple and as sad as that. How and why she got cast is a perplexing mystery. Maybe that story should be made into a movie? Skip this.",1/10
"I had high hopes for this movie, but unfortunately, it fell flat in almost every way. The plot was convoluted and poorly paced, leaving me confused and bored rather than engaged. The characters were one-dimensional, with no depth or development, making it impossible to care about their fates.

The dialogue was cringe-worthy at times, filled with clichés and awkward exchanges that felt forced. The acting didn't help either-some performances were so wooden, it was hard to believe the actors were even trying.

Visually, the movie was underwhelming. The special effects looked cheap and outdated, and the cinematography lacked any creativity or flair. Even the soundtrack felt out of place, often distracting rather than enhancing the scenes.

Overall, this film was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they're looking for a prime example of how not to make a movie.",1/10
"The film is very bad. The protagonist is not convincing in the role and the use of artificial graphic effects to replace the dwarves are the main problems. The script update is also terrible!

There is no reason for a new version of a classic work with so many modifications. They will never surpass the original version from the 1930s.

Even though a lot of money was invested, they were unable to bring the characters to life, which seem to be part of a B-grade music video, such is the lack of skill of the actors and the disconnect with the computer-created characters.

Not even the soundtrack saves the day, making the film a very weak musical and a tasteless remake.",1/10
"Gal Gadot delivers one of the most painfully unconvincing performances I've ever seen. Her acting lacks depth, emotion, and any real connection to the character. Every line feels forced, every expression hollow, and her inability to convey genuine emotion makes the film almost unbearable to watch. It's astonishing how she continues to land leading roles despite her wooden delivery and lack of range. The dialogue falls flat because of her stiff, robotic execution. Every scene she's in suffers from her complete lack of presence. She brings nothing compelling to the role, making it impossible to invest in the story. A truly dreadful performance that drags the entire film down.",1/10
"Before going into this film, there was so much hate. Oh my gosh It was unbelievable, but I finally watched the movie in the cinemas and I must admit this film is way better than I expected. Rachel zegler does a phenomenal job as snow white and I think all the new songs are really great. She has a fantastic singing voice in my opinion. I love order new addition scenes. And I really do feel like they expanded and developed a world better than I could have ever imagined it to do.

The cinematography individuals were absolutely stunning. In my opinion, oh my gosh, the colours, the vibrancy delighting it all looks amazing, dude.

I like some of the new characters. They are more less supporting characters. They don't do a whole lot but they do their jobs supporting snow whites. I also do feel like galgado's does a great job at the which people hated her for some reason, saying her acting with stiff. Yeah, she has 1 or 2 awkward moments. But overall, it's more less faithful to the original smell white, which now the only problem I have. With the movie is 2 aspects, the 7 dwarfs. I do think that divisional presentation is faithful, but I do feel a bit mixed on the whole idea of using cgi. Instead of actually hiring little people to play The Doors, I know there's a whole backlash of controversy over that involving peat to think it's buts, it is what it is. I also feel like the ending was very anti. Climactic, it just sort of ended. I expected a big battle in the final act of the first original film in 1937. It was quite dark with the 7 dwalls doing what they did. But in this original new movie, the ending while it's really good And it's very fine. I do feel like I would have loved a bit more of a dramatic climax in my opinion, but it is what it is overall. I had a great time with a movie. I know people. I'm not going to like my review for this but I enjoyed it. I like what I like. I know there's controversy surrounding it to, but, Hey, at the end of the day had a good time at the theatres and that's all that matches for me. 8, possibly, in my opinion, controversial take third best remake. In my opinion, the first best is The Jungle Book tweny 16. The second best is Cinderella, the third best. If the snow white movie and the 4 best is Aladdin, 2019. Yep, controversial take. But it is what it is go check the movie out. I highly recommend it. You will love it.",8/10
"I was wondering how different would Disney's remake of its animated classic be, and it turns out to be really different. Instead of a Prince Charming, this time we have a bandit king. And Dopey, who looks like a cute version of Dobby from Harry Potter, turns out to actually be spunky.

The wicked Queen is played by the glamorous Gal Gadot, who is clearly relishing the chance to be a baddie. She is the fun one to watch. Rachel Zegler inhabits the titular role with sufficient conviction.

The songs by Pasek and Paul are not as memorable as their earlier works, although their version of Heigh-Ho is at least clever and feisty.

The biggest letdown has to be the kiss that broke the magic spell. It is supposed to be a true love's kiss but what we see is such a weak and hesitant attempt it is truly a miracle that it was enough to wake the unconscious princess.

Compared to the animated classic, this go-round is not as sweet and straightforward but today's audiences will take what they can get.",6/10
"Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is one of the film's biggest missteps. Rather than embodying the warmth, kindness, and charm that defined the original character, Zegler delivers a performance that is painfully flat and uninspired. Her line delivery lacks emotion, and her presence on screen is devoid of the necessary charisma to carry a film of this scale. Doesn't make sense. CGI was horrible and a bit creepy. I genuinely didn't think Disney could butcher a classic this badly, but here we are.

"Disney's live-action Snow White is a perfect example of how not to handle a classic fairytale. The biggest crimes this adaptation commits is its absolute disregard for the original story. Gone is the whimsical fairytale magic, replaced with a forced, uninspired attempt at modernizing something that was never broken.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White is a complete departure from the classic character. She lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the original, instead coming across as smug and self-righteous For a film with Disney's budget, the CGI and cinematography are shockingly bland. The movie is visually sterile, lacking the rich, hand crafted beauty of the original animation.

Disney's recent trend of ""modernizing"" classics by stripping them of their core values reaches a new low here.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White is an absolute trainwreck, managing to fumble everything from storytelling to casting to visual effects. The so called modern update strips away all the charm, heart, and magic of the original, leaving behind a hollow, uninspired mess that alienates fans while failing to offer anything meaningful in return.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the warmth and innocence that made the character iconic, and the film's attempt to turn her into a strong and independent leader feels forced and out of place. The dwarfs have been controversially reimagined in a way that removes their personality, and the absence of a real Prince entirely erases one of the story's core elements. Meanwhile, Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, while visually striking, delivers a performance that is more stale than menacing.

The CGI is embarrassingly bad for a blockbuster of this scale, and the film's attempts at humor fall flat. Worst of all, it lacks the timeless magic that made Disney's classic fairy tales so beloved. This remake is a soulless cash grab that nobody asked for, and after watching it, you'll wish you hadn't. Avoid at all costs.",1/10
"Snow White is wonderful fairy tale we all grew up with. This 2025 version falls quite short of the mark and the memories. The only person besides Zegler and Gal Gadot who I recognized in the credits is Tituss Burgess and it's only his voice. Rachel Zegler is a terrible Snow White. Her singing can't cover up for her poor acting.and she is hardly convincing. Special effects and flashy sets only get you so far. Why could they not have real dwarves in the roles? Those acting folks need to eat, too. This is a mess from start to end and comes off as phony and stagey. I, usually am not critical but Snow White is a box-office bomb!!! Skip it and see something else.... NOT recommended.",2/10
"I usually watch Disney movies alone before I bring my kids to see it, but I will not subjugate my kids to this Movie, as it is visually and mentally exhausting.

It is a very weird movie, and probably the worst offender are the CGI dwarfs, and the CGI animals, they spent a lot of money on CGI but for some reason the animators did such a bad job that everything falls into the uncanny valley, it is weird visually and I think a bit nightmarish for children.

I will not say anything about the cast, everybody knows who they are regarding their acting, it was a mediocre performance, and yet again they are promoting weak man with no motivation or intelligence, which is sad to see but at the same time it makes sense why young boys do not consume this media anymore.",1/10
"A Disney classic brought up to date is what they promised, Well it seems a weird mishmash of 2 or 3 ideas and they've gone with all smashed together giving a incoherent mess, The original dwarf replacements (7 bandits) are weirdly still in the movie although it almost like your supposed to know there backstory like it was cut out and replaced with the cgi dwarfs section of the film, which also apart from singing serve no purpose whatsoever, It's like a the editing suite went made trying to please everyone at once but by doing so making it a mixed up mess with no real plot or logic.

All the charm of the Disney classic just destroyed to tick boxes, Such a shame of what could have been a classic, given the proper casting and following what came before.

"I just had the misfortune of witnessing the butchered remains of a beloved Disney classic, Snow White. The 2025 iteration, starring Rachael Zegler as the titular character, is an unmitigated disaster.

The film's troubled production history is well-documented, with numerous reshoots and last-minute changes that have resulted in a disjointed, tone-deaf mess. The CGI dwarfs, meant to be a technological marvel, come across as creepy and unconvincing. Real little people should have been cast for these roles. How far have you fallen, Disney? It's a shame, really, as the original's charm and character were deeply rooted in the memorable performances of the Seven Dwarfs.

But the real travesty here is Rachael Zegler's involvement. Her vocal disdain for the original story and its supposed ""problematic"" themes is not only misguided but also reeks of opportunism. It's clear that she's more interested in pushing her own agenda than in genuinely bringing this character to life. Her acting, as always, was extremely subpar and flat. Her only talent is that she's an above average singer.

The sole bright spot in this catastrophe is Gal Gadot, who brings a sense of gravitas and depth to her role as the Evil Queen. Her performance is a masterclass in nuance and subtlety, elevating the entire production with her presence. It's a shame that her talents are wasted in this otherwise forgettable film.

Snow White (2025) is a mess, a soulless reimagining that fails to capture the magic and wonder of the original. Even the most ardent Disney fans will find themselves checking their watches, waiting for the agony to end. Avoid this monstrosity at all costs.

*Rating:* (2/10 stars)

*Recommendation:* Stick with the 1937 original. It's a timeless classic that remains untainted by the creative bankruptcy and cynical cash-grabbing that defines Snow White (2025.)",1/10
"This movie is a hot mess. Bad CG, weird -- utterly unnecessary -- modernizing/updating of the story, uninspired performances.

Why take one of the all time classics in all of cinema history -- literally the seminal animated feature film -- and bastardize it? Yet that's what they've done. This is a movie that did NOT need to be made. You'd hope Disney might learn a lesson from this -- but if history is any indication, probably not.

If they hired some show runners/producers who actually appreciated/loved the original source material, that would go a long way to preventing this sort of disaster in the future.",1/10
"Both the characters and the message in this delightful reimagining of the beloved Disney classic raise the bar to demonstrate how powerful it is to overcome adversity and nay sayers no matter how near or how far. I saw the film with my twin nieces. I'm 61. We all left the theater talking all the way home, and beyond, about all of the terrific things we enjoyed in the film. The mixture of age old tunes with the new was well done. Adding greater dimensions to the lead characters only served to enhance the magic of this fairy tale. Cast and crew alike should be most proud of the beautiful film their time and talents produced.",8/10
"I'll leave this review short and sweet:

This is not a Walt Disney movie. It is a movie made by the people Walt Disney despised and tried to prevent from entering Hollywood.

He would be turning over in his grave if he knew what they did to his amazing movie.

I would give this a zero out of ten if there was an option. The new-age Disney deserves all the negative press forthcoming from this movie. Save your money and find the original one on blueray abd/or DVD and watch the greatness of the classic.

I hope Disney learns from this failure and starts producing movies that Walt would approve of, like they briefly did during the early 90s and 2000s. Until then, I will not be spending a penny on this failing franchise.",1/10
"There are so many things wrong with this film, that it's impossible to know where to start.

Affects: The dwarfs just look wrong, the effects are cheap, very clunky and the sort of quality the BBC were doing in the early 2000s with Walking With Dinosaurs, if anything those effects still look better now when placed side by side with Snow White.

Acting: OK the insufferable Rachel Z...... (can't bring myself to say it) can sing, but act no.

Especially bad when playing off the ""dwarfs"" It's just sooooo painful.

Budget: where did all the money go!!!! There has to be over half the budget on the cutting room floor.

And I dread to think how bad that movie would've been!!!?!!?

But in some sick way I'd quite like to see it.

This film is just wrong in so many ways, save your money, and watch the original.

Why Disney why.............",1/10
"I was looking forward this as I'm a big fan of the original, the original was the first movie I saw at the cinema as a child. The visuals were stunning and the colours vibrant and popped! I tried to ignore the noise around this for the last year or so unfortunately Rachel Zegler didn't help this movie at all, whilst on Rachel she was well meh and nothing special she can sing but that's all she offers here. Gal Gadot was a lot better than expected as the evil queen, the dwarfs were horrendous and pure nightmare fuel. This movie is a mess and largely poor more fuel onto the fire of countless poor movies Disney as produced in recent years. Sometimes classics should be left alone. This damages the original legacy as opposed to strengthen it. Rachel Xegler was a poor choice but in reality no actress would have saved this snooze fest.",1/10
"Outside of all of the bias for the film, it is clear that the movie was meant to be one story, but attempted to add parts of the original. The first story planned for this adaptation was mixed into the first animated film, creating a confusing climax and resolution. Also, the main point of removing the Prince from the 1937 movie was to make it clear that Snow White was independent and did not need a man to save her. Even if a princess falls in love with a powerful man, she is no weaker than a single one. For example, Mulan was the hero of China but still had a love interest that had a role in the army. She is considered the most skilled princess, even if she has a lover. After the backlash against this change, they replaced the Prince with a bandit (sounds like Aladdin, no?). The soundtrack bears little resemblance to the original film rather than creating supposedly new, empowering songs. While the costumes show the magic of Disney, the only one that resembles the original film is Snow White's dress, with the others bearing a slight resemblance to their counterparts. The terrifying CGI of the dwarfs appears quickly made to meet the planned release date, Rachel Zegler has little-to-no resemblance to the original Snow White (especially in the singing. Where is her famous whistle-like voice?), and Gal Gadot's performance does not appear worth 15 million dollars. This could have been a better film had it not been an adaptation, though still not great.",1/10
"It's so sad to see how disrespectfully Disney treats a German fairy tale that has been read and loved for centuries, and how disrespectfully they treat the 1937 animated film that adapted the fairy tale so wonderfully. Disney has ruined and trampled on everything that was beautiful and good about it. And since they can't seem to come up with anything of their own any more, and they can't manage anything more than tampering with the glory of past masterpieces, it would probably be better to let it go completely.

Walt Disney started with Snow White in 1937, so it would only be appropriate for it to end with Snow White in 2025.",1/10
"I was ""lucky"" to win tickets to go to an early release screening of this movie and I took my niece (since nobody else wanted to go). How a 7 year old can be bored during a Disney ""princess"" movie is beyond my comprehensive abilities but she was. This is not a good movie at all. There is no magic of the original, and the over thought characters just make this a boring movie. I used her as a judge because I really didn't want to be slanted by the bad publicity surrounding this movie but when she asked to go about 40minutes into the movie I knew it was going to be a long afternoon. Personally by the end all I could gear was my wofe saying ""I told you it would suck"" when I got home. Horrid movie, stay away and watch the original.",1/10
"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Not the first 20min or so which is almost okay, but the rest is unintentionally hilarious. I have not laughed this much in a long time at a movie.

A couple of little less negative things are that the first part of the movie is almost watchable. Mainly because it is decently true to the original. Zegler is not as bad as I thought, she can actually sing. And... uh... well, that is pretty much it.

Ignoring the Dwarfs for sanity reasons: Around the 30min mark or so this movie takes a very weird turn. Suddenly we are introduced to a bunch of characters (not the Dwarfs...) that will forever go down in history as the worst ever portrait on film. And from meeting those empty shells of characters it is all downhill.

Although Zegler is surprisingly not completely awful for most of the film, the rest of the cast are all so bad they make The Acolyte acting look masterful in comparison. The prince, whom is not a prince at all, just a robber and thief, he kisses snow like she has the plague, and Gadot is just Gadot trying to be... I dunno, some parody of an evil queen I guess.

This is about 50% true to the original, but the things they changed are so out there and so hilariously unpleasant I could not contain my laughter. This is so inapt and so badly done I cannot understand why Disney didn't shelf it or postponed it for 2 years to remake the whole thing. Someone actually approved this for the theatre. Wow. Disney... what are you doing?

I give this a 2/10 because the first 20min was almost okay and because Zegler was not as horrible as I thought she would be. But make no mistake, this is one of the worst movies you will ever see. My advice is to drink a bottle or sixteen before watching because I had a pretty fun time with this movie. Do not bring the kids though, they will not like this at all.",2/10
"Disney's live-action Snow White is a disappointing remake that fails to capture the charm of the original. Rachel Zegler's performance feels flat, lacking the innocence and warmth that made the animated Snow White so beloved. The dwarfs, redesigned in an attempt at modernization, come off as awkward and unsettling rather than endearing. The choreography is uninspired, and the new songs fail to leave an impression. Worse, the heavily modified plot strays too far from the original's timeless simplicity, making this adaptation feel unnecessary and soulless. A wasted opportunity. This had to be a bet for making the worst possible remake.",1/10
"Snow-white- Go watch this movie! It was actually really good in a cute classic Disney way. Don't let what you read online persuade you. Please make your own opinion!! I took my little nice and we both really enjoyed it. It has come classic songs from the original and Rachael's voice is amazing! So much emotion that is conveyed through her voice . It's also really visually stunning to watch! Can you tell I really enjoyed it!!??? Yes, it's a little over the top but it's a musical! I think people forget there's a style of acting for musical and it's meant to be big and convey so much energy. Do it :)",-/10
"At this stage I believe people is just saying is bad because everyone else is saying it. The movie is good. The singing is exceptional and the attention to detail is great.

It gives everything you could ask for. It has a good meaning and the hate needs to stop.

Stop following what others are saying and tar judging it for yourself. Disney never said it would be the same as the cartoons in 1937. Also, the so called ""original"" was as well totally different from the real original one.

Give it a try, you won't regret it.

The scenario and the picture motion are just incredible, will watch again for sure.",7/10
"We took my niece and nephew to see it this afternoon. It wasn't on my radar, but the kids who are 6 and 7 wanted to go. I saw the original probably 59 years ago but remembered it as being a fun story with a sweet ending. This was anything but.... The kids who normally sit mesmerized watching Disney movies were pretty disinterested after about 3 or 4 minutes and we had to keep trying to get them to stop chatting and watch the movie. After giving up on that, we just watched it with the kids perking up during the singing numbers, and then they went back to chatting. I have to say that this was a pretty bad movie overall. By the end of the movie it left us not caring about any of the characters, the story was just pointless and terrible, and the CGI characters were more like monsters to the kids than dwarfs. The magical creatures people were talking about in line were also pointless. Gal did the best with the wooden lines she was given, and Snow White was just a weird character herself. It was probably the worst written show to come out of Disney ever, so hopefully they will redeem themselves with a brand new idea! I remember when they came up with new ideas every year or so like The Little Mermaid and those shows were great for the parents and the kids.... It doesn't seem like there is any creativity left at Disney. Definitely DO NOT spend your hard earned money on this film. Take the kiddies to the ZOO instead until Disney figures it out....",2/10

"The 2025 adaptation of ""Snow White"" takes significant liberties with the classic fairy tale, resulting in a film that feels both disconnected and contrived. Rachel Zegler, cast in the titular role, emerges as a controversial choice, not merely for her distinct divergence from the traditional Snow White image, but more so due to her publicly voiced disinterest in the original film and character. This lack of affinity with her character's heritage is palpable, casting a shadow over her performance and making it difficult for audiences to connect with her portrayal of a beloved fairy tale figure.

Compounding the film's issues is the casting of Gal Gadot as the envious Queen, which strikes as particularly jarring. Gadot, undeniably charismatic, overshadows Zegler in scenes they share, which fundamentally contradicts the narrative's premise of overwhelming jealousy based on beauty. This casting misstep not only undermines the story's credibility but also disrupts the viewer's suspension of disbelief. The film thus struggles under the weight of its own casting paradox, resembling more a tale of ""the emperor's new clothes"" where the audience is expected to ignore the evident miscasting for fear of broaching sensitive topics.

Overall, Disney's attempt to modernize ""Snow White"" and imbue it with contemporary themes misfires, resulting in a film that neither honors its source material nor succeeds in crafting a compelling new vision. The film, rather than offering a fresh take on an old classic, comes off as an uninspired, muddled attempt that lacks both heart and coherence.",1/10
"Like many other remakes, the question is why?

E.g. Why remake Mary Poppins, How to Train Your Dragon, Snow White, etc etc ?

Of course the reason is alway's money. A remake is an easy, low risk cash cow. (Or so Disney thought)

If they had stuck to the original story ,it could have been a success, with modern CGI and live action to recreate the classic.

Instead they decided to make changes, for no other reason, than because they could and that immediately jars (if you're fond of the original)

I digress

What's good about the film ?

Zegler can sing and does play the role competently .

Gal Gadot looks good (too good - see below)

Some of the music is nice.

What's not so good

Absurd when the mirror lies about who's the fairest of them, all. Gadot is miscast , they needed someone of Meryl Streep's age and acting ability for the roie.

Gadot lacks both acting and singing ability.

The film jumps about story wise (which ties in with having to re-edit after bad PR)

Where did the bandits come from ?

The Prince is really just a character who does pretty much nothing.

The Dwarves just looked weird and where are all the classic songs?

If this was the first time 'Snow White' was ever made , it would be 5/10, mediocre at best.

However it's a remake of a much beloved classic cartoon and cinematic history.

Instead of paying homage, to the much beloved original. The makers chose to drive a coach and horses, followed by a couple of challenger tanks over the classic fairytale.",3/10
"I was very disappointed. I loved the original but this was done so poorly. Very sad to see a classic turned into trash. If Disney wants to re-imagine the film....why not just make a completely new one?! If the classic was so out of touch, then leave it as is and create something completely new. Don't call it something it's not. Plain and simple. I don't understand why they have to change so much from its true core. I would not recommend to anyone. It was cringy and boring. Snow White was the first true ""princess"" movie and it's terribly represented in this film. I would rate it -10/100 if it gave me a choice.",1/10
"Another poor remake with a B-grade cast trying desperately to make something of themselves. From the moment the film begins, it's apparent this is not the enchanting tale we all grew up loving. The magic, the charm, the warmth-none of it is present. Instead, what we're given is a hollow, uninspired reimagining that lacks soul, cohesion, and even basic cinematic appeal.

Let's start with the acting. At best, it's wooden; at worst, it's completely detached. The cast seems awkwardly thrown together, and not one performance manages to stand out in a meaningful way. The lead lacks the charisma and emotional depth to carry the weight of such an iconic character. There's no gravitas, no growth, and certainly no spark that would make her believable as the ""fairest of them all."" Supporting characters fare no better. Most feel like afterthoughts-poorly written and poorly portrayed. The chemistry between characters is non-existent, making it incredibly difficult to care about any of them or their fates.

The singing-another key component of any Disney musical-is underwhelming at best and jarring at worst. The original Snow White had unforgettable melodies that have endured for generations. In contrast, this remake offers forgettable and at times cringe-inducing musical numbers that feel shoehorned in rather than seamlessly woven into the narrative. Whether due to lackluster vocal performances, uninspired arrangements, or poor sound mixing, the musical moments consistently fall flat. Songs that should have elevated the emotion of a scene instead serve as distractions or unintentionally comedic breaks.

Visually, the film is also a disappointment. While Disney usually prides itself on delivering cinematic eye candy, this movie's CGI feels overdone and artificial. The enchanted forest lacks wonder, the animals lack personality, and the once-iconic imagery-like the Evil Queen's mirror or the dwarfs' cottage-feels generic and stripped of any visual identity. Even the costumes and set designs feel like low-budget approximations rather than thoughtfully crafted elements of a fantasy world.

Narratively, this remake tries too hard to be different and ends up losing the essence of what made the original beloved in the first place. In attempting to modernize the story, the filmmakers have abandoned the timeless qualities of love, kindness, and humility that defined Snow White. Instead, we're given a confused message that doesn't know whether it wants to be a fairy tale or a social commentary. It's possible to update a story for modern audiences while respecting its roots, but this film fails on both fronts. The pacing is also inconsistent-some scenes drag on with unnecessary dialogue, while others rush through important plot points with no emotional payoff.

Character development is sorely lacking. The Evil Queen, who should be a terrifying and iconic villain, comes off as flat and one-dimensional. Her motivations are murky, her presence barely menacing. Meanwhile, the dwarfs-once the heart and comic relief of the original-are reduced to mere caricatures, each lacking distinctive personalities or memorable moments.

It's also worth noting that the film's tone is all over the place. At times it feels like it's trying to be serious and grounded; at other times, it leans into goofy slapstick with no transition or consistency. This tonal confusion makes it hard to understand what kind of audience the film is even trying to appeal to.

All in all, this remake of Snow White is a misfire on almost every level. It lacks the magic, the heart, and the timeless charm that made the original a classic. Disney needs to seriously reconsider its strategy with these live-action adaptations. Nostalgia alone isn't enough. If they continue down this path-relying on mediocre casts, uninspired scripts, and tone-deaf storytelling-they'll continue to churn out flops that tarnish the legacy of their beloved animated originals. Sometimes, it's better to leave a classic untouched than to remake it so poorly.",1/10
"My family and I are Disney enthusiasts and do our best to remain optimistic in spite of critic bias before watching recent Disney releases.

Sadly, Disney has taken one of their most iconic animated films in Snow White and turned it into an unfortunate and borderline unforgivable, live remake. My children (one whom is a Snow White princess fanatic) left extremely disappointed, and my wife and I fell asleep during the film. There's a complete miss on the characters and their casting, an over saturation of CGI, and auto tuned songs spells the proverbial ""writing on the wall"" for the doom of the tragedy that is this film.

Do yourself, your family, your wallet, a big favor and wait until it comes out on Disney Plus.",1/10
"It really wasn't that bad. The story was not that far from the original. The music was tolerable. It seemed inline with what I would expect from a live action Disney movie. I even enjoyed the dwarfs. I'm not sure why people disliked it so much.

I've always liked Gal Galdot. I'm not sure that she's a singer but it was a good effort. Rachel Zegler did a fine job The set and costumes were beautiful. I really liked the dwarfs' cottage and I liked the reinvention of the classic songs.

Being a fan of all the original Disney cartoons I know that there are limitations on what they can do with live action productions and I think they did a decent job on this production.",7/10
"I was initially very excited to see this movie. Considering I was never a big fan of the animated Snow White, I thought: how could they make it any worse? Well, somehow, they managed to succeed at that. I've always loved the live action Princess movies Disney would put out -except for Maleficent- but this was miserable. It lacked all the joy of a Disney film. The script was incredibly messy, and the acting was poor. Rachel Zegler was great for the most part and had a wonderful singing voice, but Gal Gadot was the worst Evil Queen I've ever seen. And Jonathan's outfits were hideous. The romance between Jonathan and Snow was supposed to be improved upon, but somehow made worse. The choreography was non existent, especially because this is a Disney musical. Some of the songs were good, but the lack of an interesting setting to them was it's downfall.

The ending of this movie also became like the ending of Wish, another movie I didn't like.

Want something better? Watch Mirror Mirror or Once Upon A Time. Those are far superior and have better ideas of what the characters are meant to be.",2/10
"I can't believe I actually paid money to watch this film but my partner really wanted to see it and since she was graceful enough to come and watch John Wick 4 with me, I felt an obligation to even out the playing field.

What can I say about this? First off, the OG Snow White wasn't really my cup of tea but then, it wasn't aimed at people like me but I still appreciate what it represents and it's cultural significance.

I'm well aware of all of the controversy surrounding the film and it's 'star' but I tried to give a go and take it for what it is.

It's trash.

The effects are awful, everything looks like it's drenched in some kind of yellow filter and it gives you a headache after about half an hour. I don't need to mention the dwarves as they've been memed to death by this point, they're nightmare inducingly bad. Although I will admit, some of the CGI animals were kind of cute.

Some of the acting is woeful, especially from Gal Gadot who I genuinely like but she's horribly miscast here. I felt genuinely sorry for her.

The story feels like it's been cobbled together from multiple different scrips, it almost feels like several different films stitched together and it's jarring. Most of it feels off and weirdly incoherent.

Shockingly, the one aspect of the film I thought I'd hate the most (as I can not stand the woman) was Rachel Zegler, but I didn't. She's actually not bad in the role and one thing is sure, she can't half sing. She's probably the best thing in this turkey and that shocks me to say.

The songs (though well sung) are terrible, the music is typical Disney live action remake fluff, full of huge orchestral and over the top melodies that just make you cringe.

It's just a mess of a film that shouldn't have been remade. It's has very few redeeming qualities and I couldn't wait for it to end, oh and as for the ending, i won't spoil it but it's as anti climactic as it gets, I was genuinely shocked at how it wrapped up, I was like 'Really? Somebody wrote that and it passed through several script doctors and producers' Wait until you see it, it's laughable.

I hate this film, it's one of the worst cinema experiences I've had but I owed it to my partner. Who also hated the film lol It's one she's been waiting to see for ages and she was so upset at the end result, so I treated her to a nice French martini at a nearby bar to cheer her up, best part of the night :)

Sadly with this bad and age where technology is so good and you've such tremendous graphics we lacking acting talent and skills .

"Truly the worst film I've ever had the misfortune of watching thankfully, Gal Gadot and Hans Zimmer's music were there to make my suffering slightly more bearable.

Despite their best efforts couldn't save this trainwreck from crashing into the depths of creative bankruptcy.

The writing was atrocious, the dialogue felt like it was generated by a malfunctioning AI The fact that they managed to take a timeless classic and strip away everything that made it charming is honestly impressive in the worst way possible. The sheer level of self-importance in every scene was almost laughable if I wasn't too busy cringing LOL

like, imagine the poor souls who had to master this movie, every frame, one at a time, into 35 and 70mm for cinema and IMAX, having to see the horrifying CGI gnomes up-close, and in great detail

"I did not like the changes they made. The Snow White I know is gentle, soft, feminine and Rachel was anything but that. The CGI dwarfs were criminal too. Also just a really boring show in general. They added too many new songs, new storylines, changing the whole feeling of the movie. The costumes weren't great and overall I hated it. I went in hoping that all that was said about the movie was going to be just talk but it really did disappoint and I feel like I wasted my time. I don't know who produced this and really thought it would do well, they should have just scrapped it when the controversy first started.",1/10
"This movie feels even more fake than if it was animated. The characters over act like it was a school play, and the story goes nowhere.

There's no suspense or joy in this flick. The musical numbers (and there are too many) are just place holders for the next couple of scenes. I'd like to compare this to ""Cruella"" because that movie was everything this one is not: Entertaining, suspensful, fun, and with good acting and directing.

Instead they chose to make ""Snow White"" soo boring, and the dwarfs... omg, that was just ridiculous. Why make them bad CGI instead of hiring good actors for the main seven characters of the movie. Like watching - a bad - video game.",1/10
"WOW! Just saw *Snow White* tonight in Dolby Cinema, and let me tell you-THIS is how a fairytale should be done! Disney absolutely nailed it! Every single detail, from the breathtaking visuals to the heartwarming message, was pure magic. They showed that EVERYONE counts, from the smallest creature to the grandest moment. The best part was the music and the clarity on providing so much more depth to the original story that was told. For the first time, the story truly made sense, and it left me in awe.

"I did not go in with too many expectations. I loved the Disney 1937 version as a child. As a 40+ year old avid movie goer, I found this to be a nice rendition of the Grimm fairy tale. I liked the actresses in their roles. I felt that the lead roles had more depth than the original cartoon characters, but the original was a cartoon, so I expected that should occur. The dwarfs' reactions to Snow White's brought tears to my eyes. I also enjoyed the new songs and the removal of songs that did not fit this narrative. It was a good movie in that it held my attention, made me want to see the plotline through to the end and wasn't just about a princess waiting for her prince to rescue you her from her life and all the danger.",7/10
"This version of Snow White is such a big letdown. I ignored the flood of bad reviews and decided against all odds to trust and verify. I truly cannot understand why such a beloved story was thrown into a meat grinder and twisted into a farce... and it wasn't even funny! Just tragic.

Rachel Ziegler certainly did not help at all with her interviews and outspoken manner that caused a huge online backash every time she spoke to the media. Disney unfortunately did themselves another betrayal by self-mutilating yet another classic! I came out of the theater feeling puzzled and disappointed. If they wanted to change the narrative so much... why not just call it a different name??",1/10
"This utterly deplorable and worthless film bears absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the classic, beloved original Snow White tale, and sitting through it is an excruciatingly agonizing experience that tests the limits of one's patience and endurance. The legendary Walt Disney, that visionary pioneer of animation and storytelling, would undoubtedly be so horrified and distraught by the abysmal state of affairs at his once-great company that he might feel compelled to end his own life if he were alive today to witness this travesty of a movie and the complete betrayal of his artistic legacy.",1/10
"Rachel Ziegler and her acting type were truly miscast in this role, or the notes she was given were truly abhorred. At no time could I see my children liking her portrayal and personally, comparing to the original, it felt the entire tone of her performance was a miss.

As Ziegler doesn't seem able to envoke any form of sympathy from crowds it seems, maybe she'd be better suited sticking to supporting roles or another genre if fairytales aren't within her range.

There are always risks when deviating from the source material but honestly it just seemed like a better point of focus would have made a world of difference and perhaps some of the changes would have been welcomed with a more palatable lead to feed them to us.

Movies are usually a safe bet for our family but not this one, kids left tired but not in the good way :(",1/10
"One of the most loved and revered movies being remade with integral parts destroyed in the narrative because the writer/diector and actors do not understand what it stood for and the story behind it.

Snow White is a story of the victory of good vs Evil, of love and virtue... not ego 'winning' evil, breaking of family for the power of self (which is no power at all but a severe social disability).

I truly hope it is a major flop but I guess there are enough people curious and enough indoctrination of the youth through marketing to make it profitable.despite the drivel it is.

It is such a disaster in not reading the room that they had to redo the dwarfs because they in their infinite madness thought it was rude to cast dwarfs in a movie called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (not Snow White and the Seven Samurai which is another story completely written by Tom Holt and not Grimm).

Disney.... WAKE UP!!! People do not want you messing with a success.

Next up The Lion King live action remake with snails instead of Lions as depicting Scar as a vicious and evil lion is diminishing their right to be a loving and misunderstood slug... urgh.",1/10
"This new take on the classic German fairy tale by the house of mouse is truly a 'Graus' - which means ghastliness / horror / abomination in German. See what I did there?

Joking aside, we all knew from the trailer and word of mouth that this was going to be bad. But even bad movies can be enjoyed if they're just incompetent enough to be unintentionally entertaining.

Unfortunately, Snow White is'nt so-bad-it's-good either, because it lacks ambition. It doesn't aim high and miss, it aims... nowhere.

Snow White is a poster child for the common complaint from cinephiles about how ugly modern digital movies look. It's not hard to see why. Everything is shot in front of a blue screen. When you watch older movies, even failed fantasy efforts like Willow, they still look beautiful. There are shadows, contrasts, scene composition. Snow White, like many modern Disney films, looks dark and muddy. The characters hardly stand out from the background, there are no hard shadows, no bright highlights. Scenes shot in sunlight look darker than my living room.

Why is that?

Well if you compose your scene digitally, you limit yourself if you shoot your actors with hard shadows. So they shoot everything flat. And then add it into a flat scene.

The result being, that everything looks flat, boring and uncinematic.

In addition, the pacing is uneven. Kids will be bored to tears by the slow pace and lack of action and of course the socialist lectures.

People joked about this film being a DEI fest, but it's even worse than imagined. Snow White is no longer a princess, she's a feminist anti-patriarchal social justice warrior pushing for equity - through apple pies.

No, I'm not joking. More than half the movie is her giving social justice lectures about pies which amount to ""those who have more should share"". That's it, that's the message.

Rachel Zegler lacks charisma and charm, but has a decent singing voice.

Gal Gadot absolutely hams it up and is cartoonishly evil in all her scenes. While I never saw her as a great actress, every now and then she delivers a surprisingly good performance, similar to the first Wonder Woman movie. She's hits the perfect tone, and is fun to watch. Maybe it's because she is the only actor who's performance doesn't fall under bland.

Unfortunately, it's not enough to enjoy the movie.

This is by far the worst of the terrible Disney live action remakes.

Bad pacing, forgettable music, awful CGI, disturbing unexpressive dwarve, bad writing, miscast star, ugly photography, cheesy ending with the mirror and about 50 minutes too long.",1/10

"I saw an earlier screening and im in a complete and utter shock. I understand that pleasing a certain demographic is important these days but still could have done in a more artistic way. Everything in this movie from casting to screen play to the story is just pure cringe.

Rachel Zegler lacks charisma and has the amazing ability to change pleasant situations into cringe. Not taking into consideration her behavior before the release of this movie and simply on the merit alone she is robotic and lacks charisma and is not charming at all.

Gal Gadot though being drop dead gorgeous always lacked charisma and is an average actress at best. She has no real facial expression and almost sometimes feel like an android and made no effort to correct it during this movie.

The story is just complete orphan after the first 20 mins. The band wagon just completely falls off the track into a weird story making sure the male lead is degraded in every scene if possible. Im not sure what was the purpose here to change and maul a timeless classic like this and im sure the box failure will be unforgiving.",1/10
"I went along to the cinema to watch this as I'm a big Disney fan and really had high hopes for this movie and I'm a fan of Gal Gadot.

But after 10 minutes I could already tell I was in for a disappointment. Halfway through I was ready to walk out, what a complete waste of time and money. This is probably the worst live action remake they have done so far!!

Worst acting I've seen in a long time and the CGI just made it feel cheap and artificial.

What a shame as I feel this could have been a real hit if Disney had bothered to put the effort in. Don't think I'll be rushing to see anymore Disney remakes anytime soon.",1/10
"Like their reimagining of Cinderella, this update of their original film extends the story of the original but feels authentic. Dwarves are a little creepy as expected but it doesn't ruin the experience.

Snow White actually feels like royalty in this one. The male lead may not be a prince, but channels Rapunzel's Flynn Rider and does a pretty good job.

Evil Queen looks and acts the part.

On the one hand, these remakes really seem unnecessary; but if you're going to do this, then this is about as good as they could have done. Feels like Disney from a while ago before they lost their way for a while.

Really good.",9/10
"3 things I hate about it: 1. Snow White dress: looks like a cheap knockoff or a cosplay, the sleeves, the white socks, the excessively bright colors, just looks awful.

2. The digital dwarfs: horrible design , looks out of place, they tried and failed.

3. The main cast: I think Rachel Ziegler is very talented, she can act and she can sing, but she definitely was miscasted for this role, she looks like a parody, talent is not enough when you are forcing into character. Gal Gadot is very limited with her acting resources. I agree she looks amazing, but this is above her skills.

3 things I liked: 1. The songs: I feel this being a musical works perfectly and the new songs were great additions.

2. The scenarios and ambient: the castle, the town, the woods, the cabin, I really liked all of that, it feels out of the original, very fairy tale, 3. The story: I don't get the hate, but the story works. The changes are minimal and not relevant to make it bad, it's a different approach and I genuinely believe they give a different perspective to the take. If different actresses portrayed the main roles nobody would be complaining about the story.",7/10
"How to make a disaster - very good example.

Oh boy, Snow White (2025)-or as I like to call it, The Seven Missed Opportunities-is a cinematic trainwreck so spectacular that even the Evil Queen couldn't have cursed it worse. The movie is supposed to be about Snow White, but honestly, I spent most of the runtime wondering if I had accidentally walked into an unrelated, soulless Disney cash grab (oh wait, I did). They took a classic fairy tale, stripped it of its charm, and replaced it with... what, exactly? An uninspired, lifeless mess where Snow White doesn't even seem interested in being, well, Snow White.",1/10
"Disney should've learned from the completely abysmal live-action of The Lion King. Where the original animated version was full of life and emotion, the remake became nothing more than a nature documentary and a CGI. Playground. This film follows the same fate. The casting and acting was terrible. Both snow white and the queen lacked emotional range, and it felt like I was watching a table read of the script rather than an actual professional performance. The music is auto-tuned and stale, and fails to evoke emotion. The use of CGI for the dwarves (instead of actually casting smaller people) was cheesy and reminds you of a corny B-movie. I don't know how Marc Webb failed so miserably because Spiderman 1 and 500 Days were both amazing movies. Fun, funny, and the two romantic leads in those movies had crazy good chemistry. Like, really good. But he also did TASM2 and that was terrible. So, it's a hit and miss with him. I guess the story is inherently less interesting than Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, which both had excellent live-action remakes, so they had to contend with that source material.",1/10
"Disney's new Snow White is not just a swing and a miss-it's a complete betrayal of the timeless fairy tale that generations have cherished. At the center of the mess is Rachel Zegler, whose portrayal of Snow White is shockingly lifeless and condescending. Rather than honoring the role with grace and wonder, she seems more interested in mocking the original character than embodying her. Her performance is cold, smug, and drenched in modern cynicism. It's hard to tell if she even wanted to be in this film, and frankly, it shows.

Gone is the charm, the innocence, the magic. Zegler's Snow White is stripped of all the qualities that made the character iconic, replaced with a preachy, joyless figure who feels utterly out of place in a fairy tale. It's less a performance and more of a statement-and a poorly delivered one at that.

The only redeeming aspect of this disaster is Gal Gadot, who actually seems to understand the assignment. As the Evil Queen, she brings elegance, charisma, and a theatrical flair that's both entertaining and visually captivating. She outshines Zegler in every scene they share and feels like she belongs in a much better film.

This wasn't a reimagining-it was a demolition. Walt Disney would be spinning in his grave.",1/10
"Disney completely removed the core of Snow White's innocence and kindness. The songs sound too modern like every Disney princess song from the past few years. And don't get me started on Rachel Zegler bashing the original cartoon. That was also so off putting. They should've recasted Rachel Zegler and get a different actress to play Snow White while they had a chance. Also, the storyline focusing on her saving her kingdom instead of wanting true love is overused. There is nothing wrong with being soft and wanting to find love. You can want love and be strong too. You're better off sticking to the original cartoon.",1/10
"This movie is horrible on so many different levels.

For one, the main character looks more like Lord Farquaad than the ""fairest in the land"".

The dwarfs are horrifying! Like they belong in a horror movie rather than a Disney classic. My kids were genuinely scared at first. I had to explain to calm them down several times.

The acting is bad, the scenery is too fake and artificial (way too much CGI).

I am amazed at how bad this movie is all around. It definitely feels like one of those bottom of the bin direct to DVD movies. But with those at least you know what you are signing up for.

Disney massively messed this movie up. How can Snow White (Rachel Zegler) be less attractive than the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot)? To me, it seems like Disney got the characters mixed up.

Having seen the original several times with my kids, this was a disaster.

Disney needs to do way better bc it's lost another customer.",1/10
"This was one of them. I didn't have to pay to see it, and went in with an open mind thinking that hopefully it would still be entertaining despite Rachel Zegler's unlikable. It was boring, the plot was dismal, the music annoying, and visually a mess. About an hour in, I couldn't take anymore and walked out. It joins Junior, Thin Red Line, Electra, and the Marvels as movies so awful that I would rather leave and go sit in traffic than subject myself to even one more minute of it. Incidentally, there were only four other people in the theater for an opening day second showing. Avoid it if you value your time. Disney has certainly lost its ability to create quality entertainment anymore, and this may be the cherry on the cake of the garbage pile.",1/10
"The much-anticipated (or perhaps dreaded, depending on your perspective) ""Snow White 2025"" has unfortunately landed with a thud, proving to be a significant misstep for the studio. While numerous factors contribute to its overall failure, the most glaring and ultimately damaging aspect is the casting and subsequent performance of Rachel Zegler in the titular role. Instead of a fresh and captivating take on a beloved classic, we are presented with a Snow White who feels miscast, lacking the essential charm and vulnerability that define the character, ultimately dragging the entire film down with her.

From the outset, Zegler's portrayal struggles to capture the inherent innocence and gentle spirit traditionally associated with Snow White. Her performance often comes across as assertive and even slightly defiant, qualities that clash jarringly with the character's established persona. While some might argue for a ""modern"" take on Snow White, the changes feel less like empowering updates and more like a fundamental misunderstanding of the character's core essence. The audience struggles to connect with a Snow White who doesn't radiate the kindness and inherent goodness that makes her plight so compelling.

Furthermore, Zegler's vocal performance, while undoubtedly technically proficient, lacks the ethereal quality and emotional depth needed for the iconic songs. The musical numbers, instead of soaring and enchanting, often feel strained and disconnected from the emotional narrative. This is a significant blow to a story so deeply rooted in its musical heritage. The magic that should emanate from Snow White's voice is simply absent, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed and nostalgic for previous iterations.

Beyond the characterization and vocal delivery, Zegler's on-screen presence feels somewhat ill-suited to the fairytale setting. There's a disconnect between her contemporary energy and the fantastical world the film attempts to create. This is not to say that modern actors cannot inhabit period roles, but in this instance, the fit feels forced, preventing the audience from fully immersing themselves in the story.

It's difficult to ignore the sense that the casting was driven by factors other than finding the best fit for the role. While representation is undoubtedly important, prioritizing it over the fundamental qualities of the character has unfortunately resulted in a central performance that actively detracts from the film's potential. This isn't a criticism of Zegler as an individual, but rather a critique of a casting decision that ultimately sabotaged the film.

The weaknesses in Zegler's portrayal ripple outwards, negatively impacting other aspects of the movie. The dynamic between Snow White and the dwarves feels less heartwarming and more transactional, lacking the genuine affection that should be at its core. The Evil Queen's motivations, while perhaps explored with more nuance, lose some of their impact when juxtaposed with a Snow White who doesn't evoke the same level of empathy and protectiveness from the audience. Even the visual spectacle of the film feels somewhat hollow when the central character fails to resonate.

Ultimately, ""Snow White 2025"" falters significantly due to the miscasting and underwhelming performance of Rachel Zegler. While other elements of the film may have their flaws, her portrayal of Snow White lacks the essential charm, vulnerability, and vocal magic needed to bring this beloved fairytale to life. This failure to connect with the audience on a fundamental level makes it difficult to invest in the story, leaving ""Snow White 2025"" as a poisoned apple in the realm of cinematic adaptations, a cautionary tale of prioritizing casting agendas over the intrinsic needs of the character and the story itself. The film's failure will likely be attributed, in no small part, to the central performance that simply couldn't capture the enduring magic of Snow White.",1/10
"Disney's 2025 live-action Snow White is an absolute trainwreck-easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. It manages to butcher a beloved classic with uninspired performances, baffling creative choices, and some of the worst casting decisions in recent memory.

Let's start with the biggest disaster of them all: Gal Gadot. Somehow, she delivers an even worse performance than in Wonder Woman 1984-which I didn't think was possible. As the Evil Queen, she's neither menacing nor captivating; she's just painfully bad. Her line delivery is wooden, her facial expressions are awkward, and her attempt at villainous charm is laughable. At times, it feels like she's struggling just to remember her lines, and her singing? It's borderline offensive. She completely lacks the gravitas needed for the role, making every scene she's in a chore to sit through. Disney needs to do everyone a favor and never cast her in a major role again.

Rachel Zegler, as Snow White, is equally lifeless. She doesn't embody the warmth or charm of the original character, instead coming off as entitled and irritating. The chemistry between her and the Prince (or whatever they tried to turn the love interest into) is non-existent. The film's attempt to modernize Snow White by removing core elements of her story makes her character feel directionless, further dragging the already weak script down.

Visually, the movie is an eyesore. The CGI dwarfs look atrocious, the sets lack any kind of magical charm, and the whole film has this weird, cheap, over-processed aesthetic that makes it look more like a straight-to-streaming knockoff than a $200+ million Disney blockbuster.

And let's not forget the music. The new songs are completely forgettable, adding nothing of value to the film. Meanwhile, any attempt at nostalgia with the classic songs is ruined by poor arrangements and even worse performances.

If Disney was hoping this would breathe new life into their live-action remakes, they've failed miserably. Snow White (2025) is an insult to the original and a complete waste of time. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.",1/10
"First of all, I didn't have high expectations (as many of you probably didn't either). But, my partner and I actually really enjoyed it.

Definitely not a masterpiece but It's a decent remake. Charming, magical, with a great cinematography and the songs are lovely. Aside from the CGI dwarfs (which you get used to quickly), it works well.

Gal did an incredible job, but Rachel was the biggest surprise! As a fan of the original, I was initially disappointed when she was cast as Snow White, but she's incredibly TALENTED, both in acting and singing.

I insist, it's not that bad. I encourage others to watch it before judging, overall if you're a Disney fan.",9/10
"Or do actually. Here's why: I've just left the theatre and think this is a new age, war driven ""no wireeeee hanggerrrrrrssss"" performance. This movie is a pretty faithful adaptation to the animated version. There's a bit more dialogue and a lot more singing. But the story is the same? I didn't expect that. The CGI was not as distracting as I suspected? Definitely didn't expect that. And the entire cast did great except she who must not be named. GG should have her Hollywood star removed because of this performance. I don't personally like her acting choices, or lack ever thereof. And I find her politically to be in the same camp. She's been a major skip and I hope this solidifies her unbankability going forward. She, like the apple she gives out is box office poison. Her costumes were as horrible as her performance was campy. And I do not mean like good The Substance camp, nor But I'm a Cheerleader camp, just really really bad Joan Crawford impressionist camp. The castle might've been a literal putt putt course? And the seven emotions in human form were a little uncanny valley vibes at times but I think lord farquad Snow White did good in her 507 songs that she sang running through the forest hiding in the worlds brightest yellow dress you've ever seen. There were a lottttt of similarities in the script to the ongoing war in the Middle East, with Gal as the rightful villain but I'm not sure that the studio knows that it even did that. Nor that she's aware, clearly. It's either a brilliant calculation or a ""mistake"" on Disney's part. Rachel (lord farquad snow) has spoken out advocating for history's correct side and her being on the run from terror was honestly about as close to reality any Disney movie has ever gotten. With or without that recognition, the movie isn't that bad. It's pretty faithful to the source. And in this day and age... it might be important to reflect on these listed comparisons.",7/10
I did not care about all the negativity that was going around about this movie. I went in with a very positive mood thinking that all the negativity was just talk but sadly this movie just did not perform at all. My kids kept zoning out during the movie which I have never seen them before when we watch movies. I started to think well maybe it was made for older audiences but that wasn't the case either. You can tell this movie was redone multiple times and put back together. Personally it is just sad to see a classic turn out like this. My personal advice is don't waste your money on this. If you really want to see it then just wait until it is streaming somewhere and you can watch it for free this way you won't be mad about paying to see it.,1/10
Absolutely rubbish I watch this on a pirate site as I wasn't willing to waste money on the zegler flop that is snow white. Her acting is so dry that a pack of crackers has more moisture. The 7 CGI re-takes all but destroyed the original personalities of the iconic animation. The movie itself lacks soul and direction it could have been so much more but what they gave us will have you choking on that popcorn sweet or salty it won't be enough to remove the bad taste from your mouth. The last time I watched a movie with acting as bad as this was probably from The Asylum and they are experts in ripping off movies with low budget flops that slightly resembles the original names.,1/10
"This film is a prime example of everything wrong with Disney. One thing that classic (1990's and earlier) Disney had going for it was how much heart and soul their movies had. This movie, however, completely fails at that attempt. In reality, what it is is a soulless butchering of a classic. One that misses the mark in all the areas that made the original so incredible and timeless. There's no ""Disney magic"" here. No charm. Gal Gadot's performance, as with some of her other work, is quite subpar and often comes across as amateurish and cringy. This is a very forgettable film that stands as one of the most mediocre, and poorly executed, that Disney has ever put in theaters.",1/10
"Rachel Zegler is obnoxious and gal gadot is a genocidal psychopath.

Where do I even begin with Snow White (2025)? This film is a perfect storm of everything wrong with modern Hollywood: tone-deaf casting, insufferable performances, and a story so mangled it makes the original fairy tale seem like Shakespeare.

Let's start with Rachel Zegler as Snow White. Her portrayal is nothing short of obnoxious. Instead of the graceful, kind-hearted princess we all know, Zegler delivers a smug, self-righteous performance that makes you root for the Evil Queen. Her line delivery is grating, and her attempts at humor fall flatter than a pancake. It's clear she's trying way too hard to be ""relatable"" and ""modern,"" but it just comes off as cringe-worthy.

And then there's Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. If Zegler is obnoxious, Gadot is downright unwatchable. Her performance is so wooden and lifeless, it's like she's reading her lines off a cue card for the first time. The character is supposed to be menacing and cunning, but Gadot's portrayal is more like a bored Instagram influencer trying to act evil. It's laughable, but not in a good way.

The script is a disaster. Instead of embracing the timeless charm of the original story, the writers decided to inject it with a heavy-handed political agenda that feels forced and unnecessary. The dialogue is clunky, the pacing is all over the place, and the attempts at ""modernizing"" the story are so ham-fisted, they'll leave you rolling your eyes.

The visuals are equally disappointing. The CGI is so overdone it looks like a video game cutscene from 2010. The dwarfs, who are now inexplicably replaced by a group of ""magical creatures,"" are forgettable and uninspired. The film tries to be visually stunning, but it ends up looking like a cheap knockoff of *Into the Woods*.

In short, *Snow White (2025)* is a dumpster fire of a movie. It's a perfect example of how not to adapt a classic fairy tale. Rachel Zegler's obnoxious performance and Gal Gadot's lifeless acting are just the tip of the iceberg. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.",1/10

"Another major failure for Disney. How can anyone think this was going to be good? Let's see...

First, let's cast an abrasive Snow White who isn't that attractive, who hates the original 1937 movie and puts it down publicly, who insults over half the population of the USA, is a loudmouth with her political views alienating countless people, and who has marginal talent at best. Not too smart.

Second, let's take out the actual dwarves and put in full-sized people instead. When that doesn't work, let's then CGI the dwarves in, because Hollywood Head Dwarf Peter Dinklage doesn't like any other dwarves in Hollywood getting much-needed jobs but him. After Dinklage's ""outrage"" at Disney possibly actually having dwarf actors in a retitled ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,"" CGI was used instead, and seven actors won't be getting Disney paychecks. Dinklage goes against his own people, what a guy!

Third, let's ""update"" a timeless story and very successful tale for ""modern"" audiences, at the same time ignoring that the ""modern"" audiences love the 1937 original, unlike the actress playing Snow White.

And quite a few other things.....what could go wrong?

Disney obviously had too much money in this to throw it away, otherwise it really should have gone the way of, say, ""Batgirl"" which supposedly was so bad that Warner Brothers simply refused to release it in theaters or anywhere. But that was ""only"" $90 million, much less than what ""Snow White"" costs, especially including marketing.

If one really has to see this, spare yourself the expense, but out of curiosity maybe glance at it when it eventually streams on Disney if you already have their channel.

But ""Snow White"" exists, and will surely be joke fodder for years to come. It is a devastatingly inept film which frankly was a complete waste of everyone's time.",1/10
"This movie is a disaster from start to finish. ""Snow White"" left me speechless - and not in a good way. Every single scene felt like an insult to the audience's intelligence. The acting was lifeless, the writing was cringe-worthy, and the visuals were somehow both bland and chaotic. It completely butchered the charm and heart of the original story.

I genuinely felt like turning it off every five minutes. By the end, I was just angry I wasted my time. Watching this made me feel like I was being trolled. Honestly, it made me nauseous.

If you're a fan of the classic tale, stay far, far away from this trainwreck. It's not just bad - it's offensively bad.",1/10
"When it comes to adapting beloved classics for a modern audience, there's a tightrope to walk-one that balances reverence for the original with the demands of contemporary sensibilities. Unfortunately, the recent remake of Snow white stumbles badly on this tightrope, leaving fans like me longing for the unadulterated brilliance of the original. The plea is simple: the original movie was way better, and it's time to bring back the storyline that made it a timeless gem. Modernizing classics is a tricky endeavor, no doubt, but it has to be done right-or not at all.

The original movie, released decades ago, captured something pure and inimitable. Its storyline was a masterclass in specific genre or theme, e.g., suspense, romance, or adventure, weaving together key elements like character depth, pacing, or atmosphere into a narrative that resonated deeply. The characters felt alive, their motivations grounded in a world that made sense within the story's framework. It wasn't just entertainment; it was an experience-one that lingered long after the credits rolled. That magic, however, is glaringly absent in this latest iteration.

Where the original thrived on authenticity, the remake drowns in a sea of forced modernization. The decision to overhaul the classic storyline feels less like an evolution and more like a betrayal. Gone are the specific plot points or themes, e.g., slow-burn tension or heartfelt simplicity that defined the first film, replaced by a frenetic, trend-chasing mess that prioritizes flash over substance. It's as if the filmmakers decided that today's audiences couldn't handle the elegance of the original pacing or the nuance of its conflicts. Instead, we get specific examples, e.g., unnecessary subplots, CGI-heavy action, or shallow character reboots that clash with the soul of what made the movie special.

Modernizing a classic isn't inherently a bad idea-times change, and so do tastes. But there's a right way to do it, and this isn't it. Take a film like example of a successful remake, where updates enhanced the core story without sacrificing its essence. Those adaptations respected their source material, using new technology or perspectives to amplify what was already great. In contrast, this remake seems to misunderstand why the original worked. It's not enough to slap a fresh coat of paint on a masterpiece and call it progress; you have to honor the foundation while building something new. Here, the foundation feels bulldozed.

The performances, too, pale in comparison. The original cast brought a raw, unpolished energy that grounded the story-think specific actor or scene. The remake's actors, while talented, are saddled with dialogue and motivations that feel focus-grouped to death, stripping away the humanity that once shone through. Even the visuals, though technically impressive, lack the heart of the original's e.g., practical effects or cinematography. It's a textbook case of style over substance, a hollow echo of what came before.

Fans aren't asking for a shot-for-shot rehash-nostalgia alone doesn't sustain a film. But we deserve a return to the storyline that captivated us: one that trusts its audience, leans into its strengths, and doesn't bow to every modern trope. The modernization of classics can work when handled with care, but this remake proves that carelessness leads to disappointment. So here's a plea to the filmmakers: shelve the gimmicks, revisit the original blueprint, and give us back the story we fell in love with. Until then, I'll be rewatching the first movie, where the real magic still lives.",1/10
"The kids loved it. Music and cinematography were great. Gal Gadot is incredible as the evil queen . Ziegler has an Amazing singing voice.

The negative hype was unjustified. Ultimately was a good, family friendly musical that will hold up for many years. Not sure why the negativity is so prevalent especially before anyone had actually seen it. I'm sure will balance out. All the back stories about ""scandals"" aren't interesting at all.

One thing that could've been explored more is the story of the bandits probably could have been better expanded to dive more into the characters. That could've been fun.",9/10
"Imagine you're a child. Now ignore the other reviews, and enjoy the movie. Disney is going to make live actions whether you like it or not. No matter what others say, its a fun and light entertainment. Music is great, great family movie! Let's learn to relax a bit with this 1950s cultural righteousness nonsense. Stories change, and cliches are repeated. 7/10.

My favourite interpretation was that of the dwarves, definitely the best songs in the musical and the character arcs of the collective was clear and wholeseome - typical Disney.

Definitely appreciated the quality of all the actors, and I love the songs in the movie. An impressive modernization of the old story, while dutifully respective of newer generations- light hearted and less 'Grimm'. Worth a rewatch for the kids!",7/10

All around just gave me the ick. I think Disney as whole doesn't even care about this release, basically just a tax write off. I've never seen the original but I'm confident it's alot better then this one. I hope that Disney has learned a lesson.",1/10

This is the first review I have done on a movie and I feel like I need to alert everyone just how bad it is. I know Disney wants to cater for the masses and mess with the original, which if done properly, can come off really well. This didn't. I wouldn't be surprised if it was pulled from the box office.",1/10
"The movie looks and feels so artificial. The heavy reliance on CGI is overwhelming, and instead of enhancing the story, it makes everything seem fake and detached. The visuals lack depth and realism, with environments and effects that feel flat and unconvincing. This makes it hard to connect with the world or the characters, as nothing feels tangible or lived-in. It's like watching a video game cutscene rather than a film .. everything is too polished, too perfect, and completely devoid of any natural texture or authenticity. Even the action sequences, which should be thrilling, fall flat because they feel weightless and overproduced. The overuse of CGI sucks the life out of the experience, leaving it feeling cold, artificial, and ultimately forgettable.",1/10
"Disney's 2025 live-action *Snow White* is a disappointing remake that fails to recapture the original's charm, bogged down by a muddled script and tonal inconsistency. Rachel Zegler's Snow White feels disjointed, while Gal Gadot's stiff Evil Queen lacks menace, undermining the story's stakes. The CGI-heavy visuals, especially the uncanny animated dwarfs, look cheap and uninspired, draining the enchanted world of wonder. New songs by Pasek and Paul are forgettable, and the shift to a leadership-focused Snow White feels preachy and forced. It's a bland, soulless retread that neither honors the classic nor stands on its own-skip it for the 1937 original.",1/10

This movie has probably not been helped by the fact it's had such bad press so it's just not had a good image to start with so I did go in with low expectations but it was actually worse than I thought . Overall it's just awful not worth seeing.",1/10
"This is now Snow White, this is a completely different story with absolutely no substance or lesson in being kind, selfless, and respectful. Making the dwarves clean their own house after they took you in, fed you, protected you and provided to you as you watch them and sing a cringy song is the antithesis of what Snow White stands for.

The acting is subpar, the cgi is terrible, the story jumps and is clear where the reshoots were spliced in. Surprisingly, it was Gadot's acting that was the worst of it; and the ending made absolutely no sense and had no structure. Don't waste your time watching this mess.",1/10
"I really liked this movie. The cast did a great job at keeping my ten-year-old and me entertained the whole time. The acting was strong, and the characters were engaging, making it easy to stay invested in the story. I especially loved the music and score-it added so much emotion and excitement to the film. This is definitely one of the better Disney remakes in my opinion. Many remakes tend to feel overly dark, but this one had a lighter, more uplifting tone, which was refreshing. The visuals were stunning, and the special effects were impressive without being overwhelming. I also appreciated how the story stayed true to the original while adding new elements that kept it fresh. It was a great mix of nostalgia and innovation. I know a movie is truly good when I want to watch it again, and this is one I'd gladly see more than once. Disney did a great job with this adaptation, and I'd highly recommend it to both kids and adults.",9/10
"Been around for as long as IMDB exists, watch but hardly ever write.

I'm just writing because I'm saddened to see what this site has become with time, rather an echo chamber of people's political views and hate than a movie lovers place.

Do I care about Disney? Not particularly.


Any of the actors? Neither.






I'll make my review extremely short:


If you are looking for a master piece, not sure why you went watch it to begin with. It's not one, but anything between 5 and 7 depending on people is fair; A 6 for me.",6/10
"Not the worst Disney remake (Mulan and Pinocchio are worse) but still very bad.

The visuals give off that overproduced Hollywood feel lacking the artistry and magic of the original. The plot is just all over the place and doesn't know whether it wants to be it's own thing or wants to follow the original.

Zegler was decent and her singing was one of the only bright spots in the film, but Gadot gave one of the worst villain performances I have ever seen and probably the worst I have seen from her which is saying a lot considering she's a bad actress. Old songs were fine but New songs were all bland. The new characters were all underdeveloped and except Jonathan, the new love interest they didn't contribute much to the story. And the dwarves just looked plain bad.

Overall, a dull, bland, boring, lifeless film with very little redeeming qualities and a representation of everything wrong with the Hollywood of today and a desecration of Disney's legacy. As a former Disney fan and fan of the original, this movie is just heartbreaking to me and shows how far the company has fallen on recent years.

Just watch the original on Disney+ or physical media instead of this.",1/10

"What an absolute disgrace. This was a complete train wreck. Walt would roll in his cryogenic chamber. Terrible casting for Snow White. Terrible CGI . Looked cheap and nasty production. I'll stick with my original animated original thanks.

There was terrible acting. The performance felt like a poor excuse for a play Honestly seen better panto versions of this. Cast a lot better too.

I am surprised that it even got shot. The sets looked cheap. Felt like it was shot in haste to get it completed and out.

I know it's a children's movie but this is next level terrible. I loved the live version of lion king and beauty and the beast.",1/10
"If I could rate this movie a 0/10, I would! This pointless remake of the 1937 film Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is a pathetic excuse for a remake. But even saying that is generous. I watched this film with a couple of friends and even they hated it. We even walked out 40 minutes into the film.

Almost every aspect of this film is wrong. And I mean wrong. The acting, directing, script, execution of the story and cgi are abysmal, but saying that is an understatement.

The sound design, music and set designs look ok. But they are the only things that this film gets kind of right. The casting is also abysmal.

1/10. Don't watch this movie. Walt Disney is rolling in his grave.",1/10
"Horrible remake of Snow White. Whoever decided to cast Gal Gadot made the worst decision ever. She cannot act let alone be able to portray the Evil Queen. If she's in a movie, it's the first sign that the movie is full of bad acting and cheesiness. I loved Snow White as a child and this movie did not do it justice. I don't understand why Disney doesn't just remake the movie the same way as the original cartoon was. We love the originals and when you steer away, trying to change them, it doesn't work. It was the same with Mulan, Aladdin, etc. There were so many versions of Snow White movies released with the Julia Robert's one or Kristen Stewart but nothing compared to the original. This one was even worse. Don't waste your time.",1/10
"I'll start with the positive. Rachel Zegler can sing really, really well.

Her style doesn't fit with the movie because it is overly dramatic, but she is a super talented vocalist.

The negative? Everything else.

The plot was horrendous. Like D- level bad if this were a high school class submission.

The actors seem completely disinterested. The CGI is amateurish. The costumes are meh.

I went hoping it might be one of those ""so bad, it's good"" movies. It isn't. It is horrible on a scale that is hard to put into words.

As I said, by the end of the movie, I was rooting for the apple to put everyone out of their misery. Alas, that was a disappointment as well.",1/10
"Beliebe me...Don't watch it.

""Snowwhite"" is an absolute triumph of cinematic chaos. The plot is like a bad dream you can't wake up from-except you wish you could. The acting? Let's just say it's like watching a group of mannequins with no script. The special effects are so outdated, they might as well have used construction paper and glue. The dialogue feels Al-generated, but from 1995.

If you want a film that redefines 'painful' in the most entertaining way, this is your masterpiece. It's so bad, it's almost genius. Watching it is like a marathon of awkwardness, but in the best possible way!",1/10
"The movie has changed so many key, elemental parts of this movie that it has become a different story from the one we all knew and grew up with. The original was such a beloved movie for so many generations of families that even if it had been done with the traditional movie in mind, it still would have been hard to be ""just"" as good (but never better). The need for the changes to such a well established Disney story is just confusing; if they wanted to create a new, modern version, then they should have but called it something else instead of calling it a ""live remake"", because this movie is NOT a remake.",1/10
"I thought it was a super cute and fun kids movie! It is a remake so, it wasn't exactly the same as the original (none of the remakes are) but, overall stuck to the story line while giving it a modern twist. I have four little girls who really enjoyed the story line and the singing. The songs were upbeat and fun. I loved Dopey's character. I believe it really emphasized that being different is okay and that different doesn't mean ""less than."" As a mom, I thought it was a great movie that was pure and am glad that we were able to take the girls to the theatre to see it. We are excited for it to be on tv so that we can enjoy it at home!",9/10
"Not sure why this got 2 stars. It is certainly not as bad as all that. The casting choice of Snow White was perfect. She perfectly embodies the Snow White persona. Innocent, charming, strong. The movie talks about how she was born during a snow storm and that is why she is named Snow White. She still has the short black hair and the yellow, blue and red dress so everyone can chill out.

They changed a few of the songs, which is a little bit of a disappointment, but I guess the old songs are a little dated with a girl waiting for her prince to come and save her. The movie flips that narrative and Snow White actually has to save the guy, who isn't even a prince, but a rebel against the queen.

Gal Gadot is fabulous in her Snow Queen dress and jewels. She does give off evil, which I love since she so often plays the heroine. Mirror needs to have his eyes checked bc the queen is definitely the fairest in the land with those stunning looks. But I think the mirror is looking at inner beauty too. Also the play on words that the queen may be fair in beauty, but she certainly is not fair to the people.

Not the best Disney live action remake. Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid are quite better. But certainly not the worst. Better than Mufasa.",7/10
"First, I am not sure why Disney can't make more original movies instead of the endless remakes. It shows where we are at today, totally devoid of any creativeness.

I wanted to give everyone the compare the actual original story of Snow White. Especially the ending.

In the Grimm's book, the queen made one apple, but it was only PARTIALLY poisoned, the red side, the white side was fine and the queen offered Snow White the red side while eating herself the white side. When Snow White died, the Queen went back to the castle and asked the ""Looking-glass against the wall, Who is fairest of us all?"" at last it answered, ""You are the fairest now of all.""

After the dwarfs found Snow White dead they made a glass coffin for her and sat her on the mountain hill where one day the Prince rode by and offered to by her, but they first refused, until he promised to take care of her and them so the finally agreed to bring the coffin to the Castle, but on the way ""they stumbled over a bush, and with the shaking the bit of poisoned apple flew out of her throat. It was not long before she opened her eyes, threw up the cover of the coffin, and sat up, alive and well.""

While the prince and Snow White got married the Queen asked the looking-glass answered, ""O Queen, although you are of beauty rare, The young bride is a thousand times more fair."" The queen railed and cursed, and was beside herself with disappointment and anger. The queen felt she should have ""no peace until she went and saw the bride. And when she saw her she knew her for Snow-white, and could not stir from the place for anger and terror. For they had ready red-hot iron shoes, in which she had to dance until she fell down dead.""

So the queen didn't die until AFTER the wedding. Back to this new monstrosity version.

The cast was totally miscast, from Gal being way too beautiful compared to Rachel playing Snow White. It was almost laughable the stark contrast it was. The whole point of the original Snow White is the Queen was jealous of Snow White's beauty.

The original Snow White, she was a kind, selfless person that enjoyed cleaning for the 7 dwarfs, but the new one she went straight to sleep. Is cleaning and cooking that offensive these days?

Then, the atrocious looking CGI garden gnomes of the 7 dwarfs, cause apparently it was offensive to hire actual dwarfs. This is PC running amok. And unlike the original Disney characters who were distinctly different, here they all kinda looked the same.

And a lot of the important, cute exposition form the original is missing, like when Snow White comments on the names of the dwarfs after she cleans, the new one she just goes to sleep right away, like she is entitled to sleep there, compared to the original where she verbalized that IF she cleaned their place they may let her stay, in there words, she wanted to do a good deed in hopes of getting something in exchange.

The prince wasn't even a prince, he was just some thief and no real good reason why she fell for him, he was kinda annoying. That whole bandit story was utterly pointless and the ending was atrociously embarrassing.",1/10
"Disney's legacy was ruined with this cringeworthy feature.

They completely destroyed the essence of Snow White, turning a beloved classic into a lifeless, uninspired mess. The heart and soul of the original story are gone, replaced with a dull, preachy narrative that lacks charm or depth. The dwarfs, once iconic and full of personality, are now bizarre CGI creatures that look like something out of a nightmare. The film fails to capture the magic, warmth, and timeless appeal of the original.

It's a shame that Disney, once the master of dreams, is now turning them into nightmares.

Sad for the new generations...",1/10
"""The 2025 'Snow White' reboot: a cinematic experience akin to watching a screensaver slowly morph into a tax audit. Our heroine, Snow White, apparently traded her personality for a blank stare, presumably to better reflect the audience's reaction. The seven dwarves? More like seven roommates engaged in a never-ending passive-aggressive note war over fridge space. And the 'evil queen'? Darling, her villainy peaked at 'slightly raised eyebrow.' The CGI woodland creatures? Let's just say they've seen better days...in a taxidermist's nightmare. This film is less a retelling and more a cry for help from the animation department. Two stars, and those are for the catering, which was surprisingly edible.""",1/10
"If you want to change so much from the source material, then you should have made an entire different movie. It was not a good film for children or adult. Atleast Gal Gadot was a good cast since she fits the role as evil, not so much queen. If i could, i would have given it zero stars and i love Disney movies. Thats how much i hated this movie. The songs weren't memorable, the acting is just pure bad. This feels like 2/3 movies all swoon together. I really wanted to like this movie, but there is barely anything to like about this movie.

"Going in with a clear mindset. My four year old loves Princess movies and Snow White should have been no different! Except it was. And midway through the movie she asked to leave. We never listen to the outside world because it's so cruel, but I wish I had not wasted 38 dollars to watch half of this movie. My daughter deserved an opportunity to watch a good wholesome movie and this was far from it. Why did you have to change so much of a classic? What is wrong with a good classic? We went and watched Moana 2 again when we got home. The movie was literally not worth the 38 dollars for half the movie we watched.",1/10
"I went into the new Snow White movie hoping for a fresh take on the classic fairy tale. Instead, I got a joyless, uninspired mess that seems to miss the point of the original entirely.

First, let's talk about the script-if you can call it that. The film is so obsessed with ""modernizing"" the story that it strips away everything that made Snow White charming in the first place. Instead of a timeless fairy tale about kindness and overcoming adversity, we get a bland, preachy slog filled with forced dialogue and a protagonist who is about as likable as a soggy piece of toast.

The visuals? Disappointing. For a movie with Disney's budget, I expected something magical. Instead, the CGI looks rushed, and the film's overall aesthetic feels more like a low-budget streaming release than a major theatrical event. Gone is the whimsical artistry that made the original animation so iconic.

The performances don't save it either. The lead actress delivers a flat, uninspired performance, seemingly more interested in lecturing the audience than bringing Snow White to life. And don't get me started on the dwarfs-or rather, the lack thereof. Their replacements feel like an afterthought, completely missing the charm and heart that made the original characters so beloved.

Disney's attempts to ""reimagine"" this classic have resulted in a film that has neither the heart of the original nor the creativity to stand on its own. It's a lifeless, soulless attempt at storytelling that alienates fans while failing to attract a new audience.

If you love Snow White, do yourself a favor and skip this. Just rewatch the 1937 classic-it's still leagues ahead of whatever this was supposed to be.",1/10
"Great movie. After reading the initial reviews pre film I was skeptical but it turned to be magical. Snow White 2025 had all the characteristics of the old with modern take which shows a bit more reality.

Yes the CGI could have been used less but I enjoyed it. The expressions of the dwarves were captivating and came really close to reality in my opinion.

Rachel and Gal acted their characters with charm and their voices beautiful to the ears. The music is typical of Disney, gets you humming on your way home. Keep them coming :)

I liked the movie a lot and hope it gets thee recognition it deserves.",9/10
"The tale of Snow White lovingly updated and given new life after 88 years. Forget about the original for just a moment and try to see the movie through the eyes of a child. Snow White is beautifully re-imagined and is perfect for young children. An emotional journey with new songs as well as classics. A showcase for a battle between good and evil represented in a manner suitable for children. No parent wants to have a child burst into tears or leave the cinema white as a ghost. Disney and Disney theme parks are all about bringing joy to the children and adults who visit. This movie lives up to that special magic with uplifting songs and dance. Re telling the story for all, with happiness, with sadness and just a touch of darkness.

In my opinion the actors gave a very ebullient performance. Even the evil queen manages a smile here and there. See the movie without making comparisons to the original. Judge the movie on how you feel after and I am sure it will be thumbs up. If not you can always give thumbs down to this review.",7/10
"Terrible script, terrible effects, simply an unnecessary remake. You will be bored by the amount of musicals, not suitable for children, the original story should have been kept as it was when I saw it in cartoons. Rachel doesn't fit the character, GAL doesn't fit the script either, she's supposed to be a witch, at least she should have been someone with little beauty or at least hide that, simply a terrible movieIf you are going to see it with the children, don't go, they will have a terrible impression and will leave the theater bored. It's better to take them to an amusement park, your money will be better spent.",1/10
"She has never been good. Her performance fell utterly flat. I was rooting for gal' evil queen. Do not waste your money. A remake that shouldn't have been remade in the first place. Clearly no one learns that they should not remake classic Disney movies. The only one that has been good of a remake has been beauty and the beast with the lovely emma watson. Disney didn't learn their lesson. They cast someone who can not keep quiet. She ruined the movie.

The seven dwarves are the ones i was also rooting for. Had selena gomez been cast, the movie would have been better. Highly disappointed in the movie.",1/10
"I think gal gadot should stop acting. What a bad acting.definitely not sure how she passed an acting academy. Move is boring i think they could have done better but also im questioning if they actually could with her in the movie.

Overall, this version of ""Snow White"" is a disappointing mess that fails to live up to its source material. It lacks the heart, creativity, and magic that make fairy tales so enduring. Save yourself the time and revisit the classic Disney animated version instead-this one is not worth your time. What a big mess this actually is. But whatever. Go watch something else.",1/10
"Disney Remake of it's own Snow White animation is misguided on it's attempt to completely revamp the core of the classic movie.

Even if we put the baggage that comes from that change aside, there's already other 'Snow White' adaptations that turned the eponymous character into a heroine in which Disney could take notes and lessons from.

Instead, this remake turns out to be the least charming and competent of them all.

The Evil Queen is barely charismatic and is probably the only non-low point of the movie.

The Prince is non-factor, which feels like both a wasted potential and a waste of screen time.

The Dwarves creates a tonal whiplash with the serious plot that this remake is attempting to pursue.

Not to mention the plot additions are all over the place, with some pay-offs have no set up and vice versa.

If you want to watch a 'Snow White' movie with a similar premise, 'Snow White and the Huntsman' and 'Mirror Mirror' are better ways to spend your time and money.",1/10
"I don't write many reviews but I had to with this film. It's ALMOST worth seeing to just witness how bad it is but in the end it really isn't worth your time. I regret seeing it. Gal Gadot's performance is searingly bad, it is distracting every time she is on screen. They should have just cut their losses and binned this in pre-production.

From the very first scene it felt ""off"", my kids were bored watching it and wanted to leave but I kept hoping there would be some redemption but it got worse the longr the film went on, it's just drivel end to end.

Save your time and money, avoid avoid avoid.",1/10
"The new Snow White remake left me utterly unmoved and emotionally detached throughout. Instead of being swept up in the story, I found myself drifting back to childhood memories of watching the original, which only highlighted how lackluster this version feels in comparison. Even the iconic moment when the queen transforms into the sinister old witch-once a terrifying highlight that haunted me as a kid-fell flat. Far from frightening, she almost seemed endearing this time around. It's a disappointing rehash that fails to capture the magic or menace of its predecessor. I will never watch this movie again while I watched the original atleast 20-30 times in my life.",1/10
Went to see the movie with my 8 year old. We are huge disney fans and all i can say is that Walt Disney is turning over in his grave. Acting was horrible and story line made no sense. If you want to make new movies then spend the time on a good story dont just remake a classic movie and create a story line that you think fits in 2025. The music and singing was good but acting felt like something out of a low budget hallmark movie. The scenery went from an enchanted forest to a regular forest. For as kich money Disney has and te amount of true talent out there they really dropped the ball. Not worth the ticket money.,1/10
"This film is rather disturbing than charming. Many things have been said about this film. Walt Disney would be ashamed if he knew what they have made with this historical fairytale. Spoiler alarm: you will most likely be disappointed!

The magic and innocence of the original story are completely lost in this adaptation. Instead of a captivating fairy tale, we get a forced, modernized version that strips away the charm and depth of the classic. The characters feel hollow, the visuals lack the warmth and artistry of the original, and the storyline takes unnecessary liberties that add nothing of value.

It's as if the filmmakers were more interested in making a statement than in telling a compelling story. The emotional connection to Snow White and the dwarfs is missing, and the forced changes to the narrative feel more like an attempt to rewrite history rather than bring a beloved tale to life.

If you're expecting the timeless magic of Snow White, prepare for disappointment. This film is a prime example of how not to handle a classic.",1/10
"As someone who never cared much for the original Disney Snow white movie this one surprised me. It wasn't bad. It's still not an amazing movie and probably not one I would watch often but I enjoyed it a lot more than the original. With out spoiling as much as I can I'm going to say there are a lot of changes (which is to be expected with the live action versions), and I feel that those changes were made in an attempt to give more life and depth to the characters and overall plot... I loved that. As for all the hate surrounding the movie...I think that's unwarranted and tells a lot more about the character of the people watching it rather than the movie itself.",9/10
"Yes the dwarves are an abomination against art and morality Yes Gal Gadot is one of the worst actresses of all time, and might actually be the worst paid singer in a major film The portrayal of Snow White is what carries this film, she is a treat every time she is on screen

The additional plot line about having to over throw the Queen through popular revolution, is a little too close to real right now

Overall, this is one of the least offensive of the live action remakes. The original film is not really in the Disney style of animation so the bastardization of films like the Jungle Book and Lion King does not happen here.",7/10
"I spected at least a Snow White story, but it changed the characteres too much, and it did for the worse, Snow White have one of the simplist storylines, but not this one, the queen seens just lost in every scene, the prince was not even needed, snow white was forcebly kind and proud and having the need to be the center of everything, come on, that's not Snow White. It could have worked, if the script and direction knew what they really wanted for the movie, audience have to whatch this one without Snow White in the mind. Seens a total dissaster by the end of the movie. I was mad on Kristen Stewart's one, but at least that one was fun.",1/10
"I must confess, I did it-my daughter convinced me to watch Disney's new Snow White today. And yes, the rumors you've been hearing are indeed true. This adaptation of Snow White feels hollow, completely lacking in genuine magic or charm.

The dialogues come off as forced and unnatural, almost as if the writers weren't sure themselves where the story was supposed to go. Speaking of the story, it struggles to find clarity or coherence, stumbling aimlessly from one scene to the next without any real sense of direction or purpose. Most of Disney's recent remakes haven't lived up to their originals, and this one is no exception. It felt as if Disney wanted to launch something but had no clear idea what or in which direction to go.

Rachel Zegler, who portrays Snow White, spends the entire movie looking like she's genuinely surprised she landed the role-and not in a good way. Her performance feels disconnected, as if she's impersonating Snow White rather than truly embodying her.

Honestly, a more accurate title for this movie would have been ""The Surprised Impostor Calling Herself Snow White"" because that's exactly how it feels.",1/10
The movie was ok I just hate that they messed up a good movie by adding musical in it! She (Snow White) wasn't that great of an actress you can see it in her mouth the way she did it it was weird that she wasn't trying too hard. The evil queen didn't look that evil signing! She made me laugh not fear her. The thief she fell in love with looks like a regular guy who was just randomly casted. I hate that they changed the original story line a few times. The 7 dwarves looked so ugly not cute like the story shows. The bandits all were so irrelevant to this story. Overall it was not very interesting.,1/10

"Dear Lord.

This film is a soulless, joyless husk of what was once a beloved animated masterpiece. Stripped of all magic and wonder, this film trudges along with all the grace of a corporate spreadsheet-lifeless, uninspired, and designed solely to squeeze more money out of nostalgic audiences while completely disregarding what made the original special.

Let's start with the CGI dwarves, which are nothing short of an abomination. Instead of casting talented little-person actors to bring these iconic characters to life, Disney bowed to the ridiculous and hypocritical opinions of Peter Dinklage, who somehow decided that hiring little people for these roles (the same kinds of roles that have made him rich) is offensive. The result? Awful, weightless CGI creatures that look like they crawled out of a cutscene from a bad 2010s video game.

But of course, what did we expect? This is yet another of Disney's soulless cash grabs, in which they strip-mine their own classics and reduce them to uninspired, pandering disasters. Rather than creating new, compelling stories, they keep regurgitating beloved films, gutting them of heart and sincerity in the process.

And let's not even get started on how this film completely spits in the face of its audience. It takes a timeless fairy tale and mangles it into an ugly, modern, feminist lecture, force-feeding us a misguided and graceless revision of masculinity and femininity. Gone are the classic themes of love, virtue, and kindness, replaced by a clumsy, heavy-handed attempt at empowerment that lacks any charm or authenticity.

Finally, the casting is just laughable. We're seriously expected to believe that Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is jealous of the beauty of Rachel Zegler's Snow White? That's not just a stretch-it's outright comedy. It completely undermines one of the most fundamental aspects of the story. If the audience is too busy laughing at the absurdity of the premise, how are we supposed to be invested in the narrative?

At the end of the day, this film is just another example of Disney's creative bankruptcy. It disrespects its source material, alienates its audience, and fails in every way to justify its own existence. If you value good storytelling, do yourself a favor: rewatch the original and pretend this never happened.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is a disappointing, unnecessary remake that strips away the charm of the original in favour of a bland, lifeless modernisation. While the film attempts to update the classic tale with a more ""empowered"" Snow White, the result feels forced, uninspired, and ultimately hollow.

Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is underwhelming. Rather than embodying the warmth and kindness that made the original character so beloved, she comes across as disengaged and unremarkable. Her line delivery lacks depth, making it difficult to connect with her version of the character. Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen had potential, but the film fails to make her truly menacing or memorable. Instead, her performance is reduced to exaggerated expressions and weak writing.

Visually, the movie is a disaster. The CGI is particularly bad, especially when it comes to the seven dwarfs (or the awkward replacements for them). The overuse of digital effects makes everything feel artificial, lacking the organic magic of classic Disney animation or even previous live-action adaptations like Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast. Instead of feeling enchanted, I was distracted by how oddly animated and unrealistic everything looked.

The narrative itself is muddled. Disney clearly wanted to move away from the traditional fairy-tale romance, but in doing so, they created a story that lacks emotional depth. The attempts at modern empowerment feel like a checklist rather than meaningful character development. Snow White no longer dreams of love, but she also doesn't seem to have a compelling alternative goal. It's as if the film is more focused on rejecting the past than telling a strong new story.

Even the music fails to leave an impression. The new songs are forgettable, and the absence of iconic classics like Someday My Prince Will Come only makes the film feel more disconnected from its roots.

Overall, Snow White is a soulless cash grab, proving once again that not every classic needs a remake. Instead of adding something new, it takes away everything that made the original special.",1/10
"Just got out of seeing Snow White, I'll be honest-I went into it feeling uncertain. With all the buzz and mixed opinions floating around, I wasn't sure what to expect. But I wanted to give it a fair chance, to see it for myself and form my own opinion. And I'm so glad I did. This film is a wonderful and fresh reimagining of the classic tale we all know. It leans more into being a true musical, which adds so much heart and depth to the story. There were surprises throughout that completely caught me off guard, and several moments hit me emotionally in ways I never expected. I found myself tearing up more than once-not from nostalgia, but from the new ways the story brings out its magic. It's not a carbon copy of the original, and that's a good thing. It honors the spirit of the classic while breathing new life into it with bold storytelling choices, a powerful message, and enchanting visuals. It's a reminder of how timeless stories can evolve and still resonate deeply. I'll definitely be seeing it again-and I strongly recommend that everyone gives it a chance. Go into it with an open mind, and let the film speak for itself. Separate the performances from any outside noise about the cast's personal lives. You might just be surprised by how much this new take touches your heart.",9/10
"As a millennial, I really wish the reviews of these remakes could come from the intended audience...CHILDREN. My kids enjoyed the movie. My 5 year old wanted to hear the music on the way home. I have stopped getting hung up on studios remaking movies, because the remakes aren't for my generation, it's for the kids. The original Snow White came out in the 30s (nowhere near my generation) and honestly, it was time for a reimagined one. It was a cute movie and had some comedic elements, so I enjoyed myself. Gal Gadot was breathtakingly gorgeous and did a wonderful job playing a villain. The dwarves were comical and Rachel Zegler matched the character really well.",7/10
"Give a set of high school kids 500 dollars and they will build you a better set, definitely sing better, and most definitely write you a better screenplay.

I am a huge fan of the story of Snow White. From the books to the early animations it has always been a story that has captivated me. I was disappointed when I saw this will be adapted to a more modernized approach, but decided to look past that.

However, the CGI is so shockingly bad, I swear its unbelievably atrocious for effects in this day and age.

The only thing that overshadows the poor production and bad CGI, is the absolutely insanely bad acting. The lead actress is truly as bad as the negative hype surrounding her and should never have been paid a dime for her performance here. I really hope future producers see this slop from her and don't hire her for future releases.

In all, this movie for all it's many delays is lazy film making at it's best. Bad story, bad production value and really really bad acting.

Given how much a movie ticket costs these days this movie should not be allowed in theaters- in short its not even worth being put on streaming channels.

Avoid this slop at all costs and spend your money on another worthwhile movie.",1/10
Honestly i dont understand why they had to change the whole film. I did like the parts where they recreated the iconic scenes from the original but the rest of the scenes just werent that good. No hate to rachel or anything but i just didnt think that she was the best role for snow white. Her singing was very good but it just didnt feel like it suited snow white. The evil queen didnt really feel like that character was delivered very well and the 7 dwarfs did look a little scary. At this point disney need to stop changing original story lines as people are hoping to see a live action remake of their childhood film not another version of it. I am very disappointed with disney and this has to be their worst live action yet.,1/10
"I love a lot of the Disney remakes. Not this one though. It's a shame because I love the original movie, it just doesn't even compare. From the hair, costumes, and CG it's just not it. The acting also wasn't was it should be for a Disney franchise remake. If you compare it to the other remakes it's definitely disappointing. I don't think they quite captured the essence of who Snow White is, even the songs didn't align. It seems they wanted to completely change the movie from what it used to be, a little updating is fine, but this was just too different. Might as well have made a new princess movie entirely.",1/10
"That was one of the worst Disney movies ever. It literally was so painful to watch.

I went in hoping for a magical reimagining of a classic, but what I got felt more like a parody written by someone who had only heard of Snow White in passing. The charm? Gone. The whimsy? Missing in action. And Rachel Zegler's performance? Let's just say... weird, weird, weird. Every scene felt like she was auditioning for a different movie entirely. The dwarfs? Or sorry, ""not-dwarfs""? Confusing. The dialogue? Cringe. This wasn't a bold new take-it was a joyless, soulless reboot that somehow managed to make fairy tales feel depressing. Do yourself a favour: watch the original or literally anything else.",1/10
"First, it doesn't even feel like Snow White. The cgi is absolutely ridiculous. Why wouldn't Disney just use real life actors ? This film feels half live action and half cartoon. Almost like a roger rabbit kind of take. Rachel playing Snow White was definitely not the right casting choice and although a beautiful singing voice, has no presence or isn't remotely relatable to Snow White. Another really bad casting choice was Gal as the evil queen. The second hand embarrassment from the acting just made it feel as if she had given up from the get go. Forgettable songs and not the traditional story that scared Walt Disney all them decades ago. Can't imagine what he would think of the last few appalling lazy remakes.",1/10
"Snow White was an absolute disappointment. The film felt lifeless, lacking the charm and depth that made the classic story so captivating. The pacing was sluggish, the performances were flat, and the plot was a mess of forced modern twists that didn't land. Even Joker 2, which had its own issues, was a far more engaging watch. Honestly, I feel like I wasted both time and money. If only there was a way to get a refund for such a wasted cinematic experience. The whole movie just didn't capture the magic it was supposed to. Definitely not worth the hype. It was an uninspired and forgettable attempt that failed to deliver anything memorable.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White (2024): A Joyless, Soulless Trainwreck

Disney has done it again-taken a beloved classic and butchered it beyond recognition. The latest Snow White live-action remake is not only a failure as a film but also a complete insult to its source material. It strips away everything that made the original 1937 masterpiece iconic, replacing it with a dull, uninspired, and utterly joyless attempt at a ""modernized"" fairy tale. If you were hoping for a nostalgic retelling with stunning visuals, compelling characters, and heartfelt storytelling, you're in for a massive disappointment.

An Unlikable, Hollow Snow White

Let's start with the biggest problem-Snow White herself. The original Snow White was a kind-hearted, graceful, and gentle character who embodied innocence and optimism. This new version? She's cold, self-righteous, and completely lacking in charm. Instead of being a princess who inspires others with kindness, she is reimagined as a tough, independent leader who seems to look down on the very concept of a fairy tale romance.

Disney clearly wanted to push a ""modern"" version of Snow White, but in doing so, they completely erased what made her an endearing and timeless character. The worst part? The lead actress openly dismissed the original film and its themes in interviews, making it obvious that neither she nor the filmmakers had any respect for the story they were remaking. How are audiences supposed to connect with a character who seems to resent the very movie she's starring in?

Where's the Magic? Where's the Fun?

One of the most tragic aspects of this remake is its complete lack of magic and wonder. The original film was full of whimsy, from the charming dwarfs to the hauntingly beautiful Evil Queen. This version, however, is dull, lifeless, and visually uninspired.

The seven dwarfs, some of the most iconic characters in Disney history, have been all but erased, replaced with a bizarre group of ""magical creatures"" that lack any personality or charm. Their humor, heart, and unique personalities are gone, leaving nothing but generic, forgettable side characters that no one will remember five minutes after the credits roll.

Even the Evil Queen, one of Disney's most iconic villains, has been watered down. Instead of being a terrifying, vain, and manipulative villain, she's just another standard ""jealous queen"" character with no real presence or depth. Her sinister elegance and memorable lines are absent, making her feel like an afterthought rather than the driving force of the story.

A Complete Betrayal of the Classic Story

Disney has taken a timeless fairy tale and stripped it of everything that made it resonate with audiences for nearly a century. The romance? Gone. The dwarfs? Erased. The heartwarming themes of kindness and perseverance? Replaced with forced modern messaging. What remains is a film that feels more like a generic fantasy adventure rather than an actual retelling of Snow White.

The most frustrating part is that this was entirely unnecessary. If Disney wanted to tell a different story, they could have created a brand-new fairy tale rather than butchering a classic. Instead, they decided to slap the Snow White name onto something that has nothing in common with the beloved original.

Final Verdict: A Total Disaster

At this point, Disney's live-action remakes have become predictable disasters, and Snow White is just another casualty. With an unlikable protagonist, a lifeless story, and a complete disregard for the charm of the original, this film is a soulless cash grab with nothing of value to offer.

If you're a fan of the classic Snow White, avoid this movie at all costs. It does nothing but tarnish a beloved story while failing to offer anything worthwhile in return. Watch the original instead-it's a masterpiece that doesn't need ""modernization"" to remain magical.",1/10
"Here's the perfect recipe for box office disaster: take one of the most beloved animated cartoons of all time, turn it into a live action movie nobody asked for or wanted, change all of the characters around so they don't even come close to the characters in the original, and finally, as a bonus, put down half of your potential movie customers as you trash the concept of the original film. Mix it all together, throw in a huge, overblown budget and you have a potential sweep of the 2025 Razzie Awards, especially since they have removed the ""Worst Original Song"" and ""Worst Musical Score"" categories. Well done, Disney!!",1/10

"I watched Snow White having not read any other reviews and without reading about the controversies surrounding it and i thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked the new songs and the choreo and direction within them. I thought the costumes were spot on and smiled when we saw Snow White in her traditional dress in the woods. I also liked Rachel Ziegler in the role. Her character had an edge to her which I didn't think I was going to like but her direction and the more determined characterisation, I think, suited her. I liked the CGI 'dwarfs' , each one reminding us in subtle ways of the quirks which gave them their names. I found Dopey adorable... The CGI woodland animals were very very cute. Yes, there are some parts of the story which have been updated but not to the extent that it detracts or ruins the plot. So what if the male lead and 'dwarfs' all work as a team with Snow White to bring down the evil queen standing back for Snow White to take the final lead - love it. I would have no qualms at all taking children to see this film (one short and very well done scary bit in the wood ) and i would certainly go and see it again.",7/10
"I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish this. I was bored, my 7-year old was bored. The best way I can describe it is ""lifeless"". Strayed so far from the original premise the story is not recognizable. It seems like the protagonist is never in any real danger because the filmmaker seemed so intent on making her in charge and independent that it felt like,- you can just do all this on you're own, so why have supporting characters, a love interest, etc. A protagonist without likability is one thing but to be both unlikable and have zero vulnerabilities is a recipe for disaster. Terrible waste of time and money.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is proof that even when expectations are low, a movie can still find a way to disappoint.

From the start, there was plenty of skepticism about this remake, and unfortunately, the final product does nothing to change that. The film feels like it's trying so hard to be modern and different that it forgets what made the original special in the first place.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White feels forced and lifeless. The dwarfs-sorry, the ""magical outcasts""-are such a weird creative decision that they barely even feel like part of the story. Even Gal Gadot, who should've been an over-the-top, fun villain , is wasted on a bland and forgettable performance.

Visually, it's not much better. The CGI is inconsistent, the costumes feel cheap, and the whole thing lacks that classic Disney magic. The singing is properly the only thing that make it a bit more bearable.

At the end of the day, this Snow White just doesn't work. It's a remake that nobody really asked for, as it strips away everything people loved about the original.",2/10
"Being a movie lover like myself, you listen to the voice of the public, but you still try to make up your own mind.

I mean afterall, how much can they mess up such a beautiful fairytale, can't be that bad right?

Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but it really is that bad, no, actually, it's even WORSE.

This movie is a complete disaster which nukes the whole fairytale feeling.

Everything is so fake and artificial that the movie just fails to capture you in any way.

Link that with horrible acting of Rachel Zegler, and you got yourself a disaster.

Her acting throughout is movie is a disaster, you should feel love, warmth and sympathy for snow white, instead, the longer the movie goes on, the more you start to hate her.

I honestly was shocked myself that by the end of the movie I actually dislike snow white.

So please don't waste your money on this poor excuse of a fairy tale, and show your children the original one.

And to the world: PLEASE keep Rachel Zegler off the white screen FOREVER.",1/10
"I'm geniunly curios on what the producers were thinking when this ""idea"" was picthed to them. The actors are misscast, the story is a mess. And the dwarves could be put in a horror film(I know I'm going to have nightmares). How did Disney see this script and think this is going to make us a fortune. They could have thrown it on there streaming service and called it a day, than again, I wouldn't waste my time on this ""film"". I've never walked out of a theatre half way, but there really is a first time for everything. Snow White is dissrepectful to the classic and they should destroy all copies.",1/10
"Who doesn't love the original classics. I had some early hope for this one, but it's been very hard to avoid all the bad decisions being made by Disney. With that being said, I went along with my children, they seemed to be enjoying the songs, but they were ready to leave by 30 mins in. I honestly feel the best family movies are ones that capture the adults and children, but unfortunately it failed on both. I think we will stick to the original classics. I'm sure we will get more live action remakes, please please please just make them as close to the original as possible, it's really not that hard. We just want to be entertained for 2 hrs and escape into a good film.",1/10
"I wish I was kidding. I actually paid to see this in theaters, and I don't think I've ever felt so ripped off in my life. This isn't just a bad adaptation of Snow White-it's like they actively tried to ruin everything people loved about the original.

The writing is terrible, the characters are annoying, and the dialogue feels like it was written by someone who has never had a normal conversation in their life. And let's not even talk about how they butchered the original story. Instead of honoring a classic, they just replaced it with... whatever this is. It's hollow, forced, and honestly kind of embarrassing to watch.

The acting? Stiff. The visuals? Shockingly bad for a big-budget movie. The whole thing just feels lazy and soulless.

If you're thinking about watching this, don't. Seriously, save your money, read a review, and call it a day.

If I could, I'd give this a 0.",1/10
After all the drama surrounding the movie i went with a open mind but the movie is boring and not worth the money. Actors acting is bad especially Rachel Zegler and the make up was of poor quality. I also think actor should not try to think that they are above the people who pays to watch their movie. Opinion is fine but when u start thinking u r better than other ur downfall starts. Some song were fine but most of them were boring. Gal Gadot acting was same as her rest of the movie one expression to express every emotion. Other character especially dwarf had nothing to remember about and male lead was forgetful.,1/10
"I didn't walk into this film expecting much, but even with rock-bottom expectations, the new Snow White still managed to disappoint. It was awkward, joyless, and completely devoid of the heart and charm that made the original a classic.

The story was incoherent-scenes felt stitched together without any real flow, like they were just checking boxes off a badly written checklist. Snow White herself lacked personality, and the supporting characters were forgettable at best. The dwarves-or whatever they're calling them now-barely registered as characters. It felt like no one in the cast knew what kind of film they were supposed to be in.

Visually, it was dull. The sets looked like they came from a high-budget high school play, and the CGI somehow managed to feel both overused and cheap. And don't even get me started on the dialogue-it tried so hard to be modern and clever, but instead it came off as cringey and forced.

I couldn't finish it. I left early, which says a lot since I rarely ever walk out of movies. This wasn't just a bad remake-it was an insult to storytelling and to the legacy of a beloved fairytale.",1/10
"I watched the original Snow White because this movie was coming out. I was surprised to find out that not a lot happened in that movie but it was still good for its time.

My favorite song is All is Fair. I thought everyone did a great job in their roles and it's definitely something worth seeing once if you liked the original. Another thing I liked about the movie is that it didn't overstay its welcome when it comes to run-time. It wasn't excruciatingly long. It was just long enough to be good and make its point.",9/10

There again people were right about using real actors. At the end Snow White is definitely NOT the fairest of them all. I wouldn't even give it one star!

I remember watching the original Snow White animated cartoon as a kid and all the other Disney movies, they are so enjoyable to watch with kids and family . I am all for "" live adaptations "" but not when it is trash the way this movie was made. Was excited when I viewed the pre production pictures, everything looked the part .... That is until I watched the movie last night. The lead actress was horrible, did not capture the magic of who Snow White is supposed to be, almost felt like a self centered performance. I personally enjoyed Gal Gadot as the evil queen, and felt like she did bring her to life , unfortunately just in an another horrible Disney remake. Just how bad was this movie ???

"The movie was just not fun and lacked any type of chemistry and magic. From bad CGI which was apparently due to last minute rewrites. The pacing was all over the place and the arc of the story was slow and prodding.

The main Snow White actress was devoid of life and comes across as soulless and annoying. Our kids made us leave halfway through and had more fun kicking a paper cup in the parking lot outside.

Would not recommend even if it was streaming for free. The nice thing was the theater was empty and we got to use our phones stretch our legs and let the kids run around since nobody could keep interest.",1/10
"I went into this movie with an open mind and my lips zipped because my 10 and 6 year old granddaughters begged me to take them to see it. They gave me their reviews on the way home. They were disappointed and confused and even somewhat flabbergasted as to why it failed so miserably compared to their beloved original that they have watched, on DVD, so many times in their lives thus far. My 6 year old was blunt. ""PawPaw, I didn't like it at all."" My 10 year old surmised, ""I'm going to tell my girl friends not to waste their time."" Their reasons were plenty. Hey, if you're going to make a movie fir little girls, how about make it sweet, charming, enchanted and not so dull! That's all the review I might offer. I've written a bunch over the years, but relaying tidbits of my girls' disappointment really says it all. Jupiter, FL has one very nice theater though, and the food was good.

On top of that bad omen, the movie is unfortunately one remake too many. The actors' performance is subpar at best. It does not have the spirit of the story. I don't mind remakes, some movies with a great plot and storyline were butchered by the filmmaking itself, and would deserve a remake. However, here, this is not the case. Zegler tries, a bit too hard, and it's a no. The take on the story is strange to say the least, unclear, unfinished. You are left with a weird feeling of being let down. And you are....",1/10
"In my nearly fifty years of life, I have watched countless films, both in theaters and at home. Each movie has offered its own unique experience, whether it was through captivating storytelling, breathtaking visuals, or memorable performances.

However, I have never encountered a film that was so poorly executed that it compelled me to leave the theater mid-screening until now. This particular film was a complete letdown, and I am genuinely astounded that it was even released to the public.

Maybe if they switched the two main actress roles, they would have a chance, but even then I sincerely doubt it.

I'm sad for Gal Gadot, for the performances I enjoyed so far, but this could very well ruin her career.",1/10
"Against my will, I had to sit through the entire movie and wait for it to finish. I really just went on my phone and scrolled through social media because of how much it bore me.

It was definitely cheesy at times, especially towards the last few minutes of the movie. The acting was definitely... questionable. I wish they casted better actors and actresses for this movie. Then again, I don't think it would change how awful it would turn out to be. It's that unsalvageable 😭

To all the people planning on watching this movie, please listen to the reviews and critiques saying that it's terrible, because it's true 💀",1/10
"Snow White is a beautiful retelling of a classic film. It has catchy music and amazing acting, while also presenting an incredibly creative story. An amazingly talented cast and gorgeous sets makes it feel truly magical.

Based on the 1937 classic Disney animated film, the story follows Snow White (Rachel Zegler), a princess who was hidden away by her stepmother, the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot), after her father left. After having enough of her stepmother, Snow White joins forces with seven dwarfs to bring her kingdom to peace once again while they help her take down the Evil Queen.

The songs in this film, composed by Jeff Morrow, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, are expertly crafted and catchy. Every song got stuck in my head until I heard the next one, and the incredible voice talent enhances them even more. My personal favorite has to be ""Whistle While you Work"" - Rachel Zegler's voice brings incredible energy and whimsy to the song, plus I love how the whistling is used in it. The sets and cinematography, directed by Mandy Walker, are also beautiful - the lighting stands out as it works perfectly and mixed with the magnificent sets creates a fantastic looking film. One shot I really love is when we first see the cottage in the forest. The costumes, designed by Sandy Powell, are also quite beautiful; however they don't all seem to go together. Each set of costumes feels like it was meant for a different time period, which feels a bit disconnected. I really like the Evil Queen's costumes; they're flawless and not only fit the kingdom, but also her character. The characters are really well scripted, and I love the actors for each of the key characters. I especially love Rachel Zegler's performance; the amount of emotion she shows brings so much life into her character and made me feel really sympathetic for her. This film had me enchanted the whole time through its story, songs and acting.

The film's message is to follow your morals and beliefs, even if it may not present easy decisions. Be warned that there are intense scenes and blood shown at some points.

I give Snow White 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to12. It releases in theaters March 21, 2025.

"I'm genuinely puzzled by the wave of negative reviews. As someone who recently revisited the original 'Snow White,' I found this adaptation to be a refreshing and compelling update, perfectly tailored for contemporary audiences. While I deeply respect the original's historical significance and nostalgic charm, its storytelling feels undeniably dated by today's standards.

This new take masterfully expands Snow White's character, providing her with a rich backstory, a meaningful character arc, and a more nuanced plot. Crucially, it achieves this without sacrificing the heart and soul of the original story. The iconic scenes, beloved characters, and classic songs are seamlessly integrated, creating a familiar yet revitalized experience.

Yes, the ending might have veered slightly into corniness and felt a tad drawn-out. However, these minor flaws didn't detract from my overall enjoyment. This film offers a fresh and engaging perspective on a timeless classic, demonstrating that it's possible to honor the past while embracing modern storytelling techniques. For those open to a re-imagining, I highly recommend giving it a chance.",7/10
"I recently watched Disney's new Snow White, and I must say that it fell short of my expectations-particularly due to the lead actress's underwhelming performance. While there are some positive elements in the film, the portrayal of the iconic princess felt lackluster and surprisingly disconnected from the character's fairy-tale roots.

Despite the film's lavish sets and some genuinely impressive visuals, the leading actress's performance is the weak link that prevents this adaptation from achieving the timeless enchantment associated with Snow White. If you're hoping for a heartfelt, charming take on the classic fairy tale, you may find yourself disappointed by this portrayal, which lacks the authenticity and warmth that have long defined the beloved character.",1/10
"Shameful.

I do not understand what has happened to Disney productions as of late.

I used to be a massive, massive fan of pretty much everything Disney or Pixar. I would look forward to the days that I could take my children to watch any and all of their productions. As my children have aged, they now refuse to watch anything produced by this company.

As much as I hate to admit it, after this movie, I also will never ever watch another Disney production again.

Please, somebody, enlighten me as to what happened to what was one of Stalwart in the entertainment industry.

"I rarely walk away from a movie feeling completely frustrated, but this one managed to do just that. From start to finish, it was an absolute chore to sit through, and the main reason? The lead actress. She was downright awful. Every scene she was in felt forced, awkward, and lifeless, making it impossible to stay engaged with the story.

It's one thing for a movie to have a weak script or bad pacing, but when the main character is this unbearable to watch, it ruins everything. The entire experience felt like a waste of time, and I honestly regret giving it a chance. If you're considering watching this, do yourself a favor and skip it.",1/10
"This movie is another great example of Disney's recent tear of destroying everything we love for no reason. This movie truly holds up to the ""if it aint broke, dont try to fix it"" statement.

Without spoiling too much (you will spoil your day watching this but still...) the movie is extremely dull, bland and poorly executed making you wonder why you even gave it a shot.

Also the fact that they decided to go with so much CGI for the dwarfs and forest shows to me how inpersonal and lazy they have been with the huge amounts of money they have for making movies nowadays into consideration, feeling like your watching a movie playout in a themepark.

It simply does not capture the charme of the original classic, Disney what happend that we the fans are given another pointless remake with poor execution and way too much CGI?

Unfortunately there is nothing magical about this movie and it drags on and on. Really sad to see Snow White made into something quite this horrible. The story doesn't contain any familiarities from the original and does its best to literally be the opposite.

The acting wasn't even terrific or the cgi. If your a Disney lover like myself I'd definitely warn you not to go see this dire movie. Stick to the original or go and watch Mufasa that gave me nostalgia and lots of emotion, even the songs are good unlike the hideous songs in snowwhite.",1/10

"My honest thoughts on Snow White and just to clarify, Disney hasn't paid me to write something nice.

Disney's live-action remake of Snow White has been one of the most talked-about-and often unjustly maligned-films online. Despite the polarised critics and the relentless hate campaign, I firmly believe this film is pure Disney magic.

What truly stood out was how the story was adjusted for a slightly modern take. The film not only answers lingering questions about Snow White's skin color and the origin of her name but does so with a refreshing narrative twist that feels both authentic and engaging.

Rachel Zegglar delivers a brilliant performance that perfectly captures the quintessential Disney voice. She brings a captivating charm to the role, embodying the magic and wonder that the character deserves.

One of the main concerns leading up to the film was the CGI portrayal of the dwarfs. I was pleasantly surprised-these digital characters were executed flawlessly, preserving the charm of their animated counterparts. Their scenes in the diamond mine, in particular, looked stunning on screen, and I couldn't imagine them being any better served by human actors.

The musical numbers hit many high notes as well. I loved the classic ""Hi Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work,"" and the new song ""Wishing on a Wish"" was nicely done. While not every song hit the mark, the soundtrack overall enriched the fairytale atmosphere of the film.

Gal Gadot's performance, while occasionally a bit over-the-top, ultimately worked well-especially in her portrayal of the old witch with the poison apple. Even though some moments felt slightly exaggerated, her energy added an interesting dynamic to the film.

Compared to other live-action remakes like Wicked, which certainly had its moments, this version of Snow White stands out as my favorite Disney live-action adaptation so far. It exudes a pure fairytale feel that pays homage to the original animation while embracing a modern sensibility. The film might not have the grand scale of Wicked, but its charm, humor, and heart make it a delightful experience. The kids in the cinema laughed at key moments and all seemed be saying they enjoyed it leaving the cinema. My grandson, Charlie, loved it.

I wholeheartedly recommend taking your kids to see it. They'll love it, and so will you.

Rating: 7.5/10.",7/10
"Do you know how much money we spent to take the family here with tickets and popcorn and drinks? $96. And do you know what the kids said? ""This isn't Snow White.""

We all sat down and watched the original and it's a good movie that tells the story of innocence, love, acceptance, and caring. This remake could have spent some more time paying attention to those themes. Disney could have spent some more time paying attention to what makes their classic movies classics. Movies my grandparents still watched in their old age and movies my 4 year old still sits and watches today.

This isn't a classic and isn't even going to get rewatches. What are they doing at Disney? All these hundreds of millions spent for soullessness. How does old animation beat real modern actors? That's a massive question they need to ask themselves and do it fast.

Gal Gadot was perfect. She nailed the part. Andrew Burnap should have been the prince. That is all.

Lord of the Rings nailed dwarves. This movie had hot CGI garbage as dwarves. It was horrifying. Keep these travesties away from the mine cart ride or they're going to ruin that as well.

A good movie has a cast and crew and writers and producers who all deeply care about the material. This movie CLEARLY did not. It was not a complete and total buy in and turned into a massive waste of money for the studio and anyone whose kids ask to see it only to hate it.

It's not Snow White.",2/10

"I've never seen a movie this bad before. It was so awful that I actually created an IMDb profile just to give it a 1-star rating. The plot was completely nonsensical, the acting was painfully bad, and the dialogue felt like it was written by someone who had never heard real people talk. The pacing was terrible, making every minute feel like an eternity. I kept hoping it would improve, but it only got worse. The cinematography and special effects were laughable, adding to the disaster. If I could give it zero stars, I would. An absolute waste of time-horrible in every way. Disney just fell off RIP.",1/10
"I understand the reason behind the movie of wanting to recreate the movie for newer generations to be able to enjoy the movie but it misses the mark in that, as well still being able to enjoy the original timeless snow-white which is a much more enjoyable experience. The movie was and feels like a senseless cash grab. I don't understand why Disney continues with trying to recreate classical movies that in my opinion don't need to be recreated they don't change or add anything new to the movie to enhance the experience, no incentive to watch the live action version of something I watched as a kid.",1/10
"I watched Disney's new Snow White-and wow, what a trainwreck. If the goal was to drain every ounce of charm, whimsy, and storytelling from the original and replace it with awkward performances and out-of-touch messaging, then mission accomplished.

Let's talk about Rachel Zegler. Her portrayal of Snow White felt like she accidentally wandered in from a completely different movie... and didn't bother reading the script. I've seen more emotion and sincerity in high school drama class performances. And that's just on set. Off set, her interviews came off as arrogant and dismissive-almost like she resented the fact that the original even existed. You'd think someone starring in an iconic remake would at least pretend to care.

This wasn't a modern reimagining. It was a complete dismantling of a classic tale in favor of something painfully forced and joyless. The writing was weak, the visuals felt bland despite the big budget, and the whole movie seemed to scream, ""Look how progressive we are!"" instead of telling a good story.",1/10
"The acting is horrendous, the cast is mediocre, and the direction is awful. The only thing worth saving in this movie is the special effects. The lead actress seriously needs acting lessons-maybe starting with children's theater plays would help her gain real experience. Everything else feels lifeless, with performances that lack depth and a story that goes nowhere. The director fails to bring any vision, making the film a forgettable mess. Overall, it's a wasted opportunity with nothing but visuals to hold it together. A disappointment from start to finish, utterly lacking in substance and creativity.",1/10
I decided to take my kids with me seeing as it's a Disney movie and they love it. I wasn't sure if they or I would like because of the hate going around. I've grew up in the 90s with all original classics so this was big for me. I took a chance and went with it since my kids wanted me to go see with them. I kid you not during the first 30 minutes my kids wanted to leave. And mind you they are 7 to 12 years old. I find the messages there a bit to raunchy for kids movie. And not much action just talking throughout the first 30 mins. I got them to go with my wife I finished the movie and probably I would say the worst movie of Disney I've ever seen. The music choice was overbearing. The visuals were phenomenon but doesn't match with what's going on. It fell flat around the hour. Got some good moments and laughs but that's it. Please don't wast your time on this movie. I regret paying over 80 dollars that day. Very disappointed.,1/10

"Snow White, Disney's latest film, is a fresh take on the 1937 animated classic. Director Marc Webb gives the film a Broadway twist, making it more than just a nostalgic tale. With the addition of new songs and character development, the film adds a deeper dimension to the Snow White story.

Rachel Zegler does a great job of playing Snow White, giving the character more depth and spunk. She maintains the graceful movements of the animated Snow White, but with a new twist of spunk. Meanwhile, Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen gives a charming performance, although her voice doesn't always match the character.

The film has some flaws, such as the CGI effects that don't always work and the costumes look cheap. However, Webb manages to keep the film interesting with dynamic scenes and bright colors.

Overall, Snow White is one of Disney's best films of the last decade. The film successfully adapts the classic tale with a fresh and modern twist, making it well worth a watch.",8/10
"We can't say this is a masterpiece, absolutely not.

On the other hand we even can't say it's such a disaster someone wants you to believe.

All this ""anti-woke"" complaints are absolutely garbage: visually it is an enjoyable film, with good acting (I even didn't dislike Gal Gadot, I don't like much her) and respectable music.

The only thing I didn't like is how they represent the dwarves, using so much CGI.

I am very sorry to see how poor the votes are, this film doesn't deserve all this hate, in my opinion.

People who gave 1, 2 or 3 deserve to watch really awful films... not this nice reinterpretation.",7/10

"What is the worst Disney atrocity of them all why it's none other than SNOW WHITE 2025 starring Rachel Zagler The worst person in the entire world! The Dwarfs aka the weird characters that don't belong in Snow White and a movie filled with Terrible Acting horrible visuals bad characters and a buffoon of a girl That doesn't act her age! Like my god I have Never ever saw the worst movie than this Stupid ripoff! My advice watch the original from 37 ok sure it's from 1937 but still watch the original, it's way more sufferable than this Ripoff of a Film I say this movie needs to be pulled off Cinamas and NEVER release Digitally or physically This movie should be left in 2025!",1/10
"Forget about casting or whatever...out of simple greed and lack of imagination and ability to create, the modern cinema is all about remakes. Which is ok, as long as they are well made and entertaining. However, this childhood loved and cherished fairy tales is much more than just entertainment...it's an era. And, personally, for me it does fell very wrong to do any remakes, specifically so far removed from original. Regardless of which film it is, I simply don't watch any remakes of classical cartoons...Not only I grew up watching them, but my daughter too...it's too sacred for me, simple as that)! Sad...",1/10
"Such great story that I was excited to take my daughter to watch to end up with huge disappointment and my daughter looking at me like what the heck dad ?

I had to request a refund in the middle of the movie as my daughter got bored and start playing with her phone instead .

I always read to my daughter bedtime stories and this one was one of her favourites but the movie seemed a failure. Maybe one of the songs was ok but the rest was eihhhh.

Don't waste your money ,most likely will be available in Disney app in couple weeks . As not expecting that much interest from spectators.

Disney, please stop dragging us down.",1/10
"Disney's live-action remake, Snow White (2025), veers away from the original magic of Walt Disney's Snow White and the original tale. I was open to the reimagining of this classic movie but unfortunately, it fails to deliver. From lackluster performances to miscasting key roles, this film misses with audiences (at least my showing tonight).

We can all agree that Rachel Zegler who takes on the classic tale of Snow White, delivers a performance that feels stilted and unimaginative. Her acting lacks the warmth and charisma that made the original animated Snow Whitesuch a hit.

For a film with a $260 million dollar production budget, the CGI looks fake and the CGI creatures lack the expressions, warmth, and charm of the original characters.

The dwarfs have been controversially reimagined look evil and creepy.

Don't waste an evening on this disappointing reimagined disaster.",2/10
"Completely and utter garbage of a film from the moment I walked out the theater and here's the reasons why this is. 1. The gnomes, don't even get me started they give an uncanny valley sort of vibe and just genuinely ruin the immersion in the movie, secondly, gal gadots acting in this is a bottom 5 acting expression I have ever seen in a film. Lastly the film couldn't even be saved by Rachel zeglers performance, which might have been the best part of the film. What ruined her part is the AWFUL party city costume the makeup and dress department gave her, it's like they were setting up her and the film for failure.",1/10

"This movie is an absolute train wreck from start to finish. It's an insult to filmmaking and storytelling on every level. The acting is beyond atrocious, with wooden performances that make you cringe and wonder how this even got approved. The plot is a nonsensical mess that completely butchers the original story, stripping away any charm or magic that made it beloved. The visuals are horrendously cheap, and the dialogue is so cringe-inducing it's painful to sit through. It's a soulless, cash-grabbing disaster that never should have seen the light of day. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Avoid at all costs.",1/10
"I'm disappointed at the bad reviews for this movie. I thought it was a great retelling of Disney's first animated feature film! My 6 year old grandson and 13 year old granddaughter really enjoyed it too. Zegler was a fantastic Snow White. Her vocals are amazing. The original Snow White's singing was always grating to my ears. The altered storyline was refreshing while still keeping the best parts of the original and the new songs fit in seamlessly. I took off a couple stars because I felt the evil queen's character fell a little flat. Gal Gadot acted the part well considering what she had to work with. All in all, it's a wonderful, wholesome family movie!",8/10
What a surprise.. Well made movie with an updated story for today's audience. I grew up on the original and I loved it. This movie is for today.. Worth your time and attention... So hard to make a remake of such a valuable piece of Disney's history.. But it is well worth your time..aside from the backstage rivalry it is a decent attempt. Rene is a well trained in theater and it shows in this film. Gal Gadot is fine... No bad anything here. I had to see for myself and I was so happy I did. Not my movie but a very good version of an old classic. I'm.,7/10
Absolutely ruined a classic left half way through the movie . 45 minutes of musical. 15 minutes of story . Couldn't connect with any character the only decent bit what deserves a 1 start rating is the hi ho musical part . Never leave reviews but this is a exception its thats bad all 3 of us thought the same think . Don't waste your money. Movie was not advertised as a musical . I've watched musicals with less musicals in them than this completely ruined a classic . 3 minutes of acting then a 10 minute musical . Highly highly do not recommend to anyone even the children in the cinema was bored watching the film.,1/10
"Watch at your on risk. As a fan of disney movies, animation and pixar and non animated movies. The malificent movie was very good. These movies such as Aldadin not the cartoon are terrible. The dwarfs are somewhat scary or fake looking Disney why are you doing these rehash of a clasics that didn't need any reimagining. I did not watch amy trailers for this movie. The actress playing snow to Gal Gadot playing the evil queen. No offense to the snow white actress they could have used an actrees that is very pretty noot cutesy or a not so good looking evil queen. Gal Gadot earing makeup is even more beautiful. The cgi was not even good, the acting was ino cheesey, The best part of the movie is when it ended, Almost 2 hours of my life I will never get back. If you have disney plus don't pay for this movie. Good luck and be well.",1/10
"I rarely leave reviews, but this Snow White adaptation deserves a warning label. The plot was painfully boring, offering nothing fresh or engaging. It felt like the writers just went through the motions without any attempt to bring originality or emotional weight to the story.

Gal Gadot might have the looks, but she lacked the commanding presence this role needed. Honestly, someone like Angelina Jolie would have brought the intensity and edge that could have saved this mess. Jolie on screen would've added much-needed depth and unpredictability-something this film desperately lacks.

Visually, it tries to impress, but a pretty frame can't mask a hollow core. This is one of the most uninspired reboots I've seen in years.",1/10
"Zegler's portrayal of Snow White feels completely disconnected from what the character represents. Instead of breathing life into the role with warmth, kindness, and grace, we get a version of Snow White that's cold, unrelatable, and at times even dismissive of the source material. Her off-screen comments didn't help, but the real disappointment is that her performance feels phoned in, lacking the sincerity needed to carry such an iconic film.

Visually, the movie tries too hard to be modern and in doing so, strips away the fairy tale magic. The script is clunky, the pacing is awkward, and the decision to move away from the classic story beats makes it feel like Snow White in name only.

Disney has done some great things with live-action remakes, but this one misses the mark in nearly every way, starting with its casting and ending with its soulless execution.",1/10
"This movie is an absolute abomination. They butchered a classic! The acting is atrocious, the story is unrecognizable, and the whole thing is just... awful. A complete waste of time and money. Avoid at all costs! They should be ashamed. This isn't Snow White, it's a joke.

As someone who appreciates cinema in its various forms, I went into this new Snow White with an open mind, hoping for a fresh perspective or at least a competent execution of a familiar story. Unfortunately, this film is a profound disappointment on a technical and narrative level.

The direction lacks any discernible vision. The pacing is erratic, lurching from scene to scene without a clear sense of rhythm or purpose. The framing often feels amateurish, with compositions that lack visual interest or thematic resonance. There's a distinct lack of cinematic artistry on display.

The performances are uniformly uninspired. The lead actress, while perhaps given a specific direction, fails to convey any emotional depth or nuance. Her portrayal feels one-note and lacks the necessary complexity to carry the weight of the character. Supporting performances are equally flat and unmemorable.

From a narrative standpoint, the screenplay is a jumbled mess. The attempts at subverting expectations feel forced and lack the necessary groundwork to be truly impactful. The thematic explorations are shallow and underdeveloped, failing to offer any meaningful insights or fresh perspectives on the classic tale. The plot points feel contrived and the overall structure is disjointed.

The visual effects, while present, often feel unintegrated and distract from the storytelling rather than enhancing it. There's a lack of cohesion in the visual style, making the film feel disjointed and lacking a strong aesthetic identity.

Ultimately, this film fails not just as an adaptation, but as a piece of cinema in its own right. It lacks the fundamental elements of good filmmaking: compelling performances, a coherent narrative, and a strong visual language. It's a technically flawed and artistically bankrupt endeavor that offers little to engage or provoke thought. A truly missed opportunity to explore this timeless story with any genuine cinematic flair. This isn't just a bad Snow White; it's simply bad filmmaking.",1/10
"Just terrible. CGI was too much, messed up the story. Avoid! The songs were OK. Relied on the CGI too much. I was excited for this movie. Wish I wouldn't have gone now, just terrible terrible garbage they should have swapped the evil queen and Snow White, I hope they stop making movies like this especially with Rachel Ziegler. Normally, we would look forward to going to a movie like this, but this was just playing terrible. They completely rearranged the story and the whole magical creatures thing is ridiculous and reason enough to go. Avoid at all costs, Disney start thinking of original ideas again!",1/10
"This was terrible. The story was not interesting at all. The dwarfs smile wayyy too much. I mean who is that happy all the time? They were not funny at all either. The movie was for 4-6 year olds and nothing higher. I fell asleep about 20 minutes during the movie. I actually thought it was fairly ok right before the dwarfs came on screen, right when Snow White traveled through the dark forest. I was thinking this would make a great horror film, but no, all sunshine and rainbows where everybody is singing and the animals are even happy. That's Disney is 2025 for ya. And that dress, my God, it doesn't work in the real world. Who dresses like that? Gal Gadot, don't let me get started. One of the worst performances in mankind and I think she is first runner up for the Razzies next year. However, I DID enjoy when she played the evil old lady. Like I said, this could be a horror film. And what a non climatic ending of ages. It lasted what... 10 minutes? And then the evil queen is gone and everybody is back to singing! PLEASE stop with the happy singing in Disney movies! It's too fake! Do not watch, even when it goes to streaming.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White remake is a disaster, but nothing drags it down more than Gal Gadot's atrocious performance as the Evil Queen. Once again proving that no amount of expensive PR can make up for a complete lack of acting talent, Gadot delivers her lines with the same lifeless, wooden expression she's had in every role she's ever played. There is no menace, no depth, no presence-just a painfully awkward attempt at being a villain that falls flat in every scene. It's clear she was cast not for her ability to embody the role but for her name recognition, and the result is an embarrassing, cringe-inducing performance that makes even the worst Disney villains look masterful in comparison. Every moment she's on screen is a reminder that Hollywood's obsession with forcing unqualified actors into major roles is ruining films, and Snow White suffers the most from this mistake.",1/10
A touching remake with a twist of update to the story. Voices are beautiful new songs and funny witty lines. Dwarfs were great especially Dopey. Nice to see light hearted adult film that Dan appeal to a younger audience and still keep the interest of adults. Charming well done. Saw it in Dolby so colors and sound weee great. Rachel Ziegler did a great job. Songs and storyline modernized some but also keeping with some of the original tale. I saw it twice. Nice to clean the palette after seeing so many dark movies these days in the theatre. We saw many adults there for the 9 pm crowd. Brings back happy memories. It was time for a remake for sure.,8/10
"Just watched Disney's new *Snow White* and honestly, it was a huge disappointment. Visually, the film feels oddly artificial-especially the dwarfs, who look like low-effort CGI placeholders. Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks warmth and depth, making it hard to root for her, while Gal Gadot's Evil Queen feels like she's phoning it in. The script tries to modernize the story but ends up stripping it of all its charm and pacing. The musical numbers are forgettable, and the whole film leans so hard into forced sentimentality it becomes cringey. For a $270M production, it feels shockingly soulless. I'd take the 1937 version any day-it actually had heart.",-/10
"Ignoring all the bad press, this is a reasonable remake. It is never going to be the original and if that's what you're expecting, don't go. Go with an open mind and you might just enjoy it.

Some catchy songs, sticks to the story with a few minor detours and she can really sing. The Queen might be a bit scary for younger children used to the original and the film overall has a more grown up feel.

The bandit, Jonathan is a bit weak as are the queens soldiers but it's a kids film. Better than other recent remakes from Disney.

Overall, we'd watch it again, which is more than we can say for others.",7/10
"Snow White (2025) turned out to be a colossal disappointment, failing to live up to even the lowest expectations. The storyline was a convoluted disaster, riddled with plot holes and pacing issues that made it nearly impossible to follow or care about. The performances were equally uninspired-flat, wooden acting that drained any hint of magic or charm from the classic tale. Visually, it was a letdown too; the special effects felt dated, and the costumes looked like they were thrown together on a budget. This horrible movie isn't worth a single penny of your hard-earned money. Do yourself a favor and don't spend a dime to see it-there are far better ways to waste two hours of your life.",1/10
I tried to give this movie a chance even though I heard bad things... waste of my time and money. We left midway through. Don't waste your time! The acting wasn't good in my opinion and it's a horrible remake of an amazing movie they shouldn't have picked the actors they did and shouldn't have made this movie at all! I was almost embarrassed to be in there watching it. I feel bad for the ones like me that wasted their money on this horrible movie! The first movie was absolutely amazing and so realistic. This was a terrible movie and I'd say money wasted making this movie. This is my honest review.,1/10
"I took my kids to see the new Snow White movie over the weekend, expecting a magical experience since they absolutely adore the original. What a letdown. From the moment it started, it was clear this wasn't the charming tale we knew and loved. The characters felt flat, the story was a convoluted mess, and the songs-oh, the songs-were forgettable at best. My kids, who usually sit through anything with wide-eyed wonder, were fidgeting and whispering about how much they hated it. By the end, they were in tears-not from some emotional climax, but from sheer disappointment at how bad it was. I felt terrible for hyping it up. Save your money and stick to the classic; this remake is a dismal shadow of what it could've been.",1/10
"I went into Snow White (2025) with low expectations, and it still disappointed. This movie isn't just bad-it's an insult to the original fairy tale. Snow White, once kind and charming, is now a bland, lifeless character. The dwarfs? Gone, replaced by forgettable sidekicks. Not to mention, Gal Gadot acting as the Evil Queen is a trainwreck. The CGI is hollow, and the songs are forgettable. The movie forgets the magic of the original story, replacing it with preachy nonsense. I left feeling robbed. This version is proof that not everything needs a live-action remake. Thanks Disney for butchering my childhood.

0/10 Would rather eat a poisoned apple.",1/10
"This movie was a complete disaster. I love Snow White, gives me warm feelings about my childhood. I was so excited for this movie but when I was done watching it I felt betrayed. I will never get these 109 minutes back. The acting was horrible. The actress that plays the evil Stepmother was the biggest disaster of this movie. I guess casting was sleeping when they chose her. Never have I ever seen such a poor and lousy performance. Don't waste your time!! This movie is not worth it. I'm going to rewatch the original cartoon version which has 1000x better acting and more that Fairy tale feeling about it.",1/10
"Went in with an open mind. This is a movie that did not need to be made. A soul-less movie and the CGI is even terrible. It did not feel like Snow White at all - not the vibe, songs or weird side characters. Another ruined franchise. There has never been another movie so worthy of flopping. Whoever is sitting in a conference room at Disney making these decisions should be fired - though I suppose they aren't totally responsible for the star of the film burning it to the ground and sabotaging it before it even opened. If only she wasn't hateful to the press and to the original movie this movie could have at least gotten people to show up and see for themselves how terrible it was.",1/10
"If there was a 0 star rating that is what I would put. It was terrible and my young children were not impressed. Disney - what are you doing? You are losing your credibility by making movies like this.

The characters weren't up to the mark. The male lead was terrible as well as the character of the queen and Snow White just didn't portray the characteristics the classic story represents. In fact, the movie was total opposite of what the story I have grown up with and I'm a 45yr old. My kids weren't impressed and that says it all. I wish I could get my money back. Too much emphasis on nonsensical singing and music than the story itself.",1/10
"This movie was the most disappointing, disgusting and obnoxious movie that I've ever seen. It was a complete waste of time. Not only was it very poorly made, but they changed the storyline and the events in the film so much that it's not even entertaining and it's more so just obnoxious and cheap. It was very bad and I don't think I'll be watching new Disney movies when they come out. This film was abhorrent and I will definitely not watch anymore of the new Disney movies because of how disappointing and frustrating this film was to watch. I could've used my time doing a bunch of other things or to watch a movie made by actual directors & film producers. This thing looks like it was made by a kindergarten so it's hard to even call it a film or even to give it any credibility.",1/10
"I will speak for my family, we enjoy musicals and this one although not perfect, did include some catchy songs. We are big fans of the Greatest Showman and some of the beats and lyrics seem familiar. Rachel Zegler has a beautiful voice, and I will admit Gal as gorgeous as she looks does not have a great voice. Visually the locations were a nice touch, I can agree that at first the CGI took a few minutes to get used to, but it's a live remake and that is what happens in most cartoon to live remakes. I think the backlash to this movie is similar to the backlash to The Little Mermaids remake, so if you don't have the same hangups about casting, you will likely enjoy the movie.",8/10
"Took my 9yo to see this film. Had low expectations due to the negativity surrounding the movie. They were wrong. This is a GREAT FAMILY MOVIE! Smiled throughout. Miss 9yo loved it. She has been singing the songs on repeat since.

Rachel Zegler (Snow White) is excellent in the role. She belts out song after song. My favourite part was the dwarfs. The film updates their songs for a modern day feel and makes them as slapstick as the original film. My daughter and I laughed hard at their antics.

Only disappointment was Gal Gadot who gave a boring performance.

Overall I highly recommend this film for family audiences that love a Disney musical. My family loved it. Thank you Disney.",7/10

"I wanted to enjoy this movie, I've loved Disney for as long as I can remember but this is just a terrible remake of a true classic. I'll be the first to say remakes are rarely if ever as good as the original. The acting is not good at all with the exception of Gal Godat, she is fantastic, you can't help but keep your eyes on her.

With regards to the movie itself the CGI was also terrible. Whenever you try to mix real people with a CGI character you're asking for something terrible looking and this was just that.

I can't help but think this movie was made strictly for profit and not to entertain, inspire or even create a new generation of Disney fans.

Do yourself a favor and wait for this to stream on your favorite platform or just watch the original, it truly is one of the greatest movies.",1/10
"Disney's live-action Snow White remake is a misguided attempt at modernizing a classic that ultimately strips away the charm of the original. It suffers from a weak script, uninspired performances, and a lack of the magic that made the 1937 classic so beloved.

The biggest issue lies in its reimagining of the characters and story. The attempt to update Snow White's character feels forced, and the absence of key elements such as the iconic dwarfs only makes it worse. The villain lacks the menacing presence of the animated Evil Queen, making the conflict feel dull and uninspired.

Despite a lavish production budget, the CGI is often distracting rather than immersive, and the musical numbers fail to leave an impression. Instead of paying homage to a timeless tale, this adaptation comes across as another soulless remake that fails to justify its existence.",1/10
"The evil witch doesn't fare any better, delivering wooden, unconvincing performances that make even the most dramatic moments feel flat. Instead of feeling like a beloved fairy tale brought to life, this movie comes across as a forced, soulless cash grab that fails to capture any of the heart of the original.

Visually, it's just as bad. The CGI looks rushed, the costumes lack imagination, and the overall production design feels cheap. The writing is equally dreadful, filled with cringeworthy dialogue and unnecessary changes that do nothing to improve the story.

This remake never should have happened. Instead of honoring a timeless classic, it butchers everything that made Snow White special. Save yourself the frustration and skip this disaster.",1/10
"So bad that the theatre was giving refunds to those who were walking out. People might want to find a copy on the bootleg sites and preview before taking their kids. They will probably decide to just let them watch the cartoon on their home televisions.

The lead actors have the skills normally found in the third level roles.the directing is sophomori, and the movie depends heavily on sub-standard CGI. The sound is good. The costumes are creative, but this is supposed to be a medieval tale. The costumes do not match the setting. The entire story is radically changed. They should have just made a new movie with a new title and left ""Snow White"" alone.",1/10
"You'll need more than suspension of disbelief to imagine Rachel Zegler's Snow White is the fairest of them all.

With terrible casting and horrible writing, the entire movie felt forced and soulless. Something is wrong at the House of Mouse, the magic is gone!

It seems that there is no one left at Disney who understands what made their classics timeless and wonderful.

Even the animation was subpar. The annimation is outdated and looked like something from the late 1990's or 2000's appearing flat and lifeless.

Casting Rachel Zegler as Snow White was another failure for the House of Mouse. Her acting was like a bad meme. Dialog was poor, acting was forgettable, and worst of all there was just no charisma.

If I had it to do over again, I'd skip this one.",1/10
"This is the worst remake of a classic movie ever done by Disney - can't believe how bad the cgi was.

I love Disney but this is by far the worst one they have done! Bad casting!!

How can you pick talentless actress to play the lead villain? She literally was the worst cast! There were so many others you could have picked! Should have just stuck to Angelina Jolie as maleficent! She played the villain the best! This was the worst! I wouldn't bother wasting my time with this ever again. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone especially not to those of us in our late 30s to early 40s who grew up with Disney!",1/10
"It is a generic take that leaves little ""WOW this was worth it"" feeling. Nothing new, nothing awe inspiring just meh. Zegler was plainly irritating throughout and problems the film only minutely rescued by some ok CGI. Kids thought it was boring and switched off. The only reason I went to see as certainly would not spend money on this alone. My 4 year old enjoyed Gurdians of the Galaxy 3 more. This is an uninspiring and unforgivably lazy attempt ( yet again) at a live action reboot. Fingers crossed Moana is better as I will be dragged to that too in the future. Avoid the cinema costs and wait for the stream to be available as at least to can stop watching and put something better on.",2/10
"Enjoyed it very much, especially the first half. Perfect? No.. no movie is perfect, but such fanservice! The singing is amazing as well! Catchy new songs as well by the way. The story itself has a few changes here and there if you compare to the original, but some of these changes were more logic / realistic if you ask me. The Evil Queen could have been a bit 'more', I find her a bit too passive aggressive. All by all, the movie gave me that wonderous feeling I had as a child watching SnowWhite. The effects were good enough for me. Only the dwarfs seemed indeed a bit rushed. Liked the balance though between real animals and the Disney kind of animals. Really enjoyed it, didn't expect it actually. 🙂",8/10
"First of all, Disney needs to just stop making live action films. The only good one was Cinderella and that was the first one. Or just bring back Kenneth Branagh to direct again. I really expected this to be much worse than it was. But even though Rachel Zegler really is not the fairest in the land, she did a decent job in the role. And she sang the new songs beautifully. I missed ""I'm wishing for the one I love"" but I guess they wanted to make Snow White less needy? Gal Gadot is just stunning and did a great job as the evil queen. That mirror was nuts though saying Snow White was more fair because that was just a flat out lie. I really wish they used real people for the dwarves. The computer generated dwarves were very off putting. You eventually get used to them, but they never stop being creepy. Overall I am glad I saw it. But, it wasn't necessary to remake this movie.",7/10

"A princess joins forces with seven dwarfs to liberate her kingdom from her cruel stepmother the Evil Queen. A live-action adaptation of the 1937 Disney animated film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".

I wanted to give this a chance mostly because I love Gal Gadot. But, if you have a live action film, you can't colour it as if it was a cartoon. That's a hybrid film and has proven not to work, and it doesn't work here.

Also, they aren't dwarves. I don't know what they are but they aren't dwarfs.

Emilia Faucher who plays the young Snow White put in the best performance of any of the cast. That fact is shameful.

The magic mirror's voice, is that from the 60's?

And Gal Gadot has acted much better in the past. I don't know whether it was stresses with Zegler or simply a poor director but Gal was definitely not on form in this film.

And Zegler...well...she is literally playing a person who wants to impress on the screen. She's not playing a part of Snow White, she is very clearly trying to play anyway she can that she thinks will make her look good on screen. We've all seen it before but not in one so young. Also, just a quick reminder from the story of Snow White, ""Soon after that, the kind queen got her wish when she gave birth to a baby girl who had skin white as snow, lips red as blood, and hair black as ebony. They named the baby princess Snow White, but sadly, the queen died after giving birth to Snow White."" Now the American born and raised Zegler states that she identifies as latino due to some Colombian ancestor, and the fact that she clearly is not white in colour or culture. She is a DEI hire and we all know it, and we all dislike it because it shames the original story.

That said, I tried to be objective about the film and no matter what you think of any of the people in their personal lives, the film is a poor remake, and takes the shine from the original because of it. Disney have dropped the ball on this one as they knew it was coming, and they should have cancelled the film and taken the hit.

I rated it a 2 and the only reason it got that was because of Emilia Faucher.",2/10
"Gal Gadot, 8/10 Rachel Zegler, 2/10

Almost every decision concerning this movie was wrong.

Choice of actors, bad.

Radically altered storyline, bad.

CGI dwarves, abysmal.

Ostracising real dwarf actors, nonsensical.

Rachel Zegler seemed to do her very best to tank the movie 2 years ago with her poorly thought out comments in every interview.

Even Good natured Gal couldn't stand her by the end of the initial media rounds.

It just goes on and on.

Even people who rated this well, deep down, know they're only fooling themselves.

Disney did everything they could to save this movie but it was never going to be enough.

Do better, Disney.",1/10
"I have been thinking, was this really necessary? The amount of money that spent on this was really necessary? Was the remake really necessary for the world and audience? This movie was literally so bad that I fell asleep and woke up in some different movie that was playing. Yeah, she sings well but the rest? Money spent for CGI etc. The casting is terrible, the idea behind this movie is not good at all. Sometimes we don't have to change the ideas thinking that we are making the world better but please. Let old things stay like that and that's why we call them legacy stuff. This was the most unnecessary remake in my life. Those studios don't care the audience at all but their personal thoughts. If you pass and don't listen what your audience says at all, you'll go down so bad as a history.",1/10
"Why making bad live actions? This one is particularly foul. Who is your intended audience? Because this is not what a child would like and it completely alienates Older audiences. The casting is horrible and the story is just similar but not the same.

This moving adds NOTHING to anyone. Please stay away.

I hope that Disney learns from its mistakes. We really miss Disney movies. Having Kids myself I think twice before taking them to see an unappealing movie with no redeeming qualities.

I can not stress enough to Disney than they are options of where our discretionary income goes and this is certainly not it.",2/10
Had some really bad popcorn. The soda was really bad and didn't feel that good so I left halfway through the second part of the last intro to the end of the trailer. So didn't bother with the credits as I was at home making this review. Nothing left to say but don't watch my review as it's probably better than Snow White and the 7 small men. Dwarves are cooler than small men and I fell like the show let me down to the level of the dwarves. Singing was good but it was all in my head since I was not at the theatre. I was at home eating popcorn watching the original thinking it's way better than the new one.,1/10
"These are all too obviously agonising and backlash-second-guessing, but knowing that at some basic level the brand identity has to be kept pristine. This is particularly evident in the costume design, with which the wicked witch gets a pointy dark crown and skull-hugging black balaclava and Snow White is lumbered with a supermarket-retail tweenie outfit with puffy-sleeved shoulders. Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot are now forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives.

Disney's exhaustingly awful reboot axes the prince and makes the dwarves mo-cap.",1/10
"Unsurprisingly another soulless remake and another case of corporatism. The animation is lackluster, poorly done CGI, not very good casting, soundtrack quality was bad, pacing was completely nauseating, and overall this movie is a horrible poisonous mess, way more poisonous than the poison apple. Racheal Z or whatever her name is, was not very charismatic and managed to mess it up so badly that it hurts. Honestly, it pretty much tarnished the legacy of Disney at this point and damaged on one of the very first films that Disney made. I didn't even bother to watch it and neither I will.

Final verdict... 1/10.",1/10
"This is a glorious re-telling of the classic, and by far the best live action version of a Disney classic yet.

Zegler is a perfect Snow White, and Gadot is just great as the evil stepmother. There are many nre songs which fit the tone of the film wonderfully, but it's the ""whistle while you work"" that hits it out of the park.

That's not to say it's perfect. The CGI dwarfs don't always work, though I have to say that they were better than I first expected.

See it yourself with an open mind. You'll be completely surprised.",9/10
"Let start saying, this new live actions have nothing to do with nostalgia, they are intended for new generations and I had been enjoying most of them with my family.

Rachel has an undeniable amazing voice, she was great on the movie, but her hair style and costume were terrible.

Gal was spectacular as the Evil Queen, on the other side her costume and hairpieces were stuning, same for the guard costumes.

The story was pretty similar to the original, not really significant big changes. I really enjoy the pacing of the movie, and the acting was accordingly to what's needed for a musical. No complains on that part. The songs were the best part of the movie. Even the dwarfs were kind of weird for the firat few min but then you just get used to them. I think Dopey and Doc got all the love from the CGI team. Entertaining and great movie to watch with the family.

Worst part of the movie, the bandits.",7/10
"Disney's Snow White is a complete disappointment, failing both as a remake and as a standalone film. Instead of honoring the original 1937 classic, the movie strips away its heart and charm, replacing it with bland storytelling, uninspired performances, and baffling creative choices.

The film's biggest flaw is its lack of respect for the source material. Gone is the timeless fairy tale magic, replaced with a forced and preachy narrative that feels more like a checklist of modern studio mandates than a genuine attempt to tell a great story. The absence of the iconic dwarfs-one of the most beloved parts of the original-only makes things worse, as their replacements add nothing memorable.

Most likely Disney's worst remake yet.. honestly, not surprised.",1/10

"When I watched this, the theatre was about empty (perhaps only around 20% occupancy) which was unusual for this kind of film featuring popular stories and casts. The film is basically visually stunning, but the casting is a disaster. Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot completely miss the mark-Zegler's performance feels totally forced, to be honest it was hard to watch, and Gadot lacks the menace needed for the Evil Queen. Strangely, the supporting cast feels more natural than the leads. The CGI, though, is amazing-the enchanted forest and Disney-style animal companions are a highlight. The story was altered to fit modern culture, which isn't the real issue-the weak performances are. A visually beautiful yet ultimately disappointing adaptation.",3/10
"""Snow White"" fails to capture the magic of the original animated classic, opting instead for a hollow and uninspired retelling. The film's attempts at modernization feel forced and contrived, sacrificing the timeless charm of the source material for a series of lackluster clichés.

The performances are uniformly wooden, with even the most seasoned actors phoning it in. The dialogue is clunky and unnatural, often veering into cringe-worthy territory. The characters lack depth and complexity, reduced to mere archetypes devoid of any real personality.

Visually, the film is a mess. The CGI is distractingly poor, with the fantastical elements looking cheap and unconvincing. The costume design is equally uninspired, failing to create any sense of wonder or enchantment. The musical numbers are forgettable, lacking the iconic melodies that made the original film so beloved.

The plot is a meandering mess, lacking any sense of urgency or tension. The pacing is sluggish, with long stretches of dull exposition and tedious filler. The film's attempts at humor fall flat, eliciting more groans than laughs.

Overall, ""Snow White"" is a soulless and uninspired remake that fails to capture the magic of the original. It's a film that feels more like a cynical cash grab than a genuine attempt to reimagine a beloved classic. Save your time and money, and stick with the animated masterpiece.",2/10
My kids asked to leave after 20mins. I honestly regretted spending $60 on the tickets for them to see it. Funniest part is we weren't even the first or second ones to walk out. This is by far the absolute worst movie in Disney's shimozzle of horrible movies. Someone seriously has to take a step back and think to themselves about why anyone was allowed to release this. My daughter's even sat through the entirety of cats yet could not handle over 20 minutes of this movie. If I could taste this one less then a score of 1 I would. Was absolutely horribly disappointing and I'm updated I can't get my 20 minutes back.,1/10
"Of all the mediocre Disney live remakes.... This take the cake. First time in my life i had to walk out of the cinema. My kids was bored, i was bored.

I wouldn't even call this a remake of the first movie. It has non of the charms, love, and story telling as the first.

They ruined the story, they butcherd the music, and the acting is like non of the actors care about it at all.

What amazes me is that Disney clearly hasn't realized that they're alienating their fanbase, which is why that they sadly will not change anytime soon.

This was complete waste of money, and my time. Ill never go to another disney premier again.",1/10
"So the movie should be about a beautiful girl, Snow White, takes refuge in the forest in the house of seven dwarfs to hide from her stepmother, the wicked Queen. The Queen is jealous because she wants to be known as ""the fairest in the land,"" and Snow White's beauty surpasses her own buy it doesn't.

Really poor casting and wardrobe choices too. Very disappointing. Defo worse dianey movie every. Not sure why they didn't hault releasing it must have scored poorly in focus groups too surely.

Lets hope disney next movie is much better though through and better quality than this 1 star movie come on Disney!",1/10

"Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt-we all know their intentions. My takeaway from the film: Rachel Zegler embodies the character of Snow White perfectly fine, with strong acting and nearly perfect vocals. The forest creatures and Seven Drawfs are whimsical and charming, and at times the highlight of the movie. The original songs are fun and the classic songs are done well. My only critiques are that the pacing and storyline felt clunky at times toward the beginning/middle, and Gal Gadot fell flat..especially compared to the original and other variations-and I really hope she never sings on camera again. Overall, I had enjoyed this comparatively far better than a few other Disney live action reimaginings.",7/10
"I wanted to love this remake, but the actress that played snow whites part was a total failure. The actress that played the evil queen should have taken the role of Snow White. I don't know what Disney was thinking. Waste of 26 dollars at the theater, so disappointed. I think the movie would have been better if they had decided to stick to the original storyline and cast a better main actress. I do not think I would go back and watch this movie if they paid me $26 to go instead of me paying $26 to go. I don't understand how anybody could watch this movie and enjoy it. It's that absolutely horrendous.",1/10
"Oh, where to begin? This 'Snow White' rendition is a catastrophic misstep. From the jarringly artificial CGI that renders the forest scenes into a nauseating cartoon, to the utterly flat performances, this film fails on every conceivable level. The musical numbers are forgettable, at best, and actively painful at worst. The attempts to 'modernize' the classic tale result in a convoluted mess, stripping away the very essence of what made the original so beloved. The dialogue is clunky, the pacing is abysmal, and the overall experience is one of profound disappointment. It is a sad day when a beloved classic is so butchered. The magic is gone. If you have any fondness for the original animated movie, stay far away from this. It is a waste of time, and money. This film is an insult to the original. A truly terrible movie.",1/10
"This might actually be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Calling it a ""movie"" feels generous-it's more like an insult to cinema itself. Every second dragged on like an eternity of pure suffering. The plot, if you can even call it that, was a lifeless, incoherent mess. The dialogue felt like it was written by someone who has never heard real humans speak. The acting? A disaster. I've seen store mannequins with more emotion. The pacing was torturous, stretching a paper-thin story into an unbearable slog. I was so bored that staring at a blank wall felt more entertaining. Every choice made in this film was the wrong one. I wouldn't rewatch this if someone paid me. It's an insult to time, money, and sanity. An insult to the original Snow White.",1/10
The weirdness for this was too much. I understand that Remakes are tough business. It's just hard when you are getting into moving and you are expecting some familiarity and it just takes a step back. I don't think the acting was very good. It lacked a lot of soul. You could tell there was some AI unregularities it just really was a disappointment. I guess I wish they would go back to making movies that give it that old fashioned feel to get you closer to the characters and feel like you're in an actual fairy tale from days ago. Of course you expect the good aha moments and things like that they had a few and who doesn't enjoy a few pyrotechnics. Definitely not worth your time to watch it.,1/10
"They lost their soul. With this remake they want to dictate new things and make influence in some other direction... Disney you are losing the meaning of family and love and fairytales they made disaster of a movie and the leading role i have no words for her.. Disappointed, disgraceful decision to make the movie like this. What they think is there any chance that you have people who think and know how Disney was created and what were the motivations goals of creating movies for kids or you get bunch of people who are fully engaged in creating new standards and making ridiculous decisions about fairytales...

"I just wasted two hours of my life on the steaming pile of garbage that is the new Snow White. This movie sucks so bad it's almost impressive-like, how do you even fail this hard at a story everyone already knows? The acting was wooden enough to build a log cabin, the dialogue sounded like it was written by a toddler with a thesaurus, and the CGI looked like a cheap video game from 2003. They butchered every ounce of charm from the original tale and replaced it with a cringe-fest of forced messages and zero chemistry between the characters. The dwarves? More like dwarfed by the sheer incompetence of this production. Save your money, save your time, save your soul-skip this abomination.",1/10
"My kids an I were very dissapointed. We were in the cinema and after 20minutes the first poeple left. We prefer the old movie. Hopefully we will come back to produce such beautiful movies like before the year 2000.

From my perspective also the dwarfs were not like in the original storyline and, most of all, boring and funny characters.

Many scenes were out of the typical storyline and also the camera view were not kids like from my perspektive. We left after one hour the cinema, oberall a very disappointing and wasted time.

Maybe in the future we should take it morte from the oroginal storyline.",1/10

I was ""watching this movie"" I thought snow white was beautiful, but all the hype was not worth it. The CGI of this movie is insanely bad even the plot of this story is bad.

I even showed this movie to my cousin, and he got sick the next day. I've never experienced a movie this bad in MY ENTIRE LIFE. This movie doesn't even deserve a star.

"#SnowWhite is a fresh film that offers a delightful blend of magic, heart, and humor and perfectly captures the essence of Disney films from the Disney Renaissance age. Snow White will undoubtedly be solidified as one of the best, if not the best Disney live-action films, one that somehow managed the rare feat of surpassing its original version. Rachel Zegler was perfectly cast as the titular character, and Gal Gadot's scene-stealing performance as the Evil Queen is delightful. Zegler's silky smooth vocals dazzle in ""Waiting on a Wish"" and Gadot steals the show with an iconic rendition of original song ""All is Fair"" with a husky, sensual voice that I would best describe as a blend of Dua Lipa and Fiona Apple.",8/10
"Having lurked on IMDb for a decade, I felt compelled to come and write this review. Is this movie the best Disney ever? No. Was it a decent, modern retelling of a childhood classic? Yes. Does it deserve a shred of the hate being piled upon it? Absolutely not. This movie was a fine way to spend an afternoon at the cinema with my 8 year old daughter, and I would implore people to have a look at the critic reviews rather than the public, because it doesn't deserve this... There were some lovely throwbacks to the original and yes, the story has moved past needing a redundant Prince Charming. We particularly enjoyed Dopey's character development and as with most modern day movies, this film was a visual treat. Please give it a chance.",7/10
"If you seen it you know what it is, there should be an option to sue because this was everything but entertainment, i just paid to suffer basically.

I was not interested in the movie but whenever there's hate or hype, i find myself curious to watch it, I usually tend to like the hated movies and dislike some hyped movies but this was not the case... There' s just nothing special about it, feels rushed, they used a name to pull views because they knew if they made a movie this sloppy with an original story nobody would even give it a shot. Then there's the fact that they used this actress who said publicly that the story is terrible they should pay her more to work on it, so i really felt like she was forced to play that role and was not even trying.",1/10
"Let's not forget this is a remake of a masterpiece.

Disney go out there way to make it very different.theres not even a prince anymore.it doesn't help that zegler(Snow White) has consistently criticised the original film

This film is another example of why Disney are declining very fast, if you want to enjoy Snow White then watch the original. Same goes for all of the Disney films released in the past 5 years.

I think Disney should admit they are now in a huge crisis and need to take a new direction fast.this will be another so called block buster movie that will lose money

Hardly surprising they pulled the premiers.",1/10
"Why not hire good actors and writers for such a Disney classic? I think they made this movie a joke for a reason, just to put a thumb in the face of good old fashioned values.

The writing was boring and unfunny, the new songs were recycled pop we have heard a million times before and the actors who could actually act looked like they were phoning it in.

"Oh Disney. Yet another lack lustre reboot of one of your all time classics. I am not entirely sure how you managed to rip the soul of this more than you did the Little Mermaid. It's quite bizarre how you could have miscast this so badly. No chemistry between any of the leads. The story was mediocre at best and the attempts at humour fell extremely flat. So many continuity issues to mention as well.

The only 2 parts of the movie I truly enjoyed were 'Hi Ho' because I really did rather like the animated Dwarves, especially Dopey who I think was truly adorable. And 'Whistle while you work' was equally sweet and did have a smidge of that ol' Disney magic. But all of the new songs were instantly forgettable though. And Gal Gadot was not the evil queen we deserved. I had secretly hoped that Lana Parilla would be typecast into her role... because really, who could ever match her. Certainly not Gal. Her Evil Queen went out with a whizz pop, not a bang completely robbing us of seeing the comeuppance of good vs evil finale she (and the audience) deserved.

How could you get Beauty & the Beast so right (I am sure others will disagree but I loved it) and have consistently failed so miserably with the rest of these attempts at keeping the magic alive in the numerous live action reboots since. Please just stop already.",4/10
"Just a complete waste of time spending watching this. Go support movies that don't discriminate and cause division in the world. We don't need movies like this and especially actors who think they are the main character in life. There are many other movies and actors you can support that deserve the recognition. I will not be recommending this to anyone i know. The performances, particularly those of Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, lacked depth and passion. Rachel doesn't seem to like any sort of romance and really thinks the prince is a stalker and dislikes his involvement, so much for imagination. She is so wrong and out of date herself.",1/10
"Disclaimer: I am incredibly easy to entertain and I am a sucker for a good love story The only thing I didn't enjoy about this film was the CGI dwarfs. Real people could have played those parts exponentially better than CGI made it. The only ones I could tell apart were Doc and Dopey (and sometimes Grumpy) the rest were difficult to differentiate between unless they were displaying their namesake The rest of the film was amazing. The animals had a friendly cartoony look that really worked, Rachel Zegler and Andrew Burnap had amazing chemistry and it was adorable. Some of the songs were iffy but Waiting on a Wish and A Hand Meets a Hand were incredible. All in all I adored this film (as someone who went in with a pessimistic view on it because they love the original) I left the theater wanting to immediately watch it again.",9/10
"My friend and I decided to watch this movie to reminisce, the unique casting and storytelling that gives a new twist is quite refreshing, the acting of the players is quite good, I hope Gal Gadot can be a little more brutal, but considering this movie will be enjoyed by children, I tried to enjoy it with an open mind. The CGI is also quite fun, the animals that appear are very characterful and memorable, the 7 dwarfs are fun, and the depiction of their beautiful home and the mine where they work is quite good. The climax scene is quite good even though I was confused by the red veil worn by Snow White with a story from a different movie. The songs are beautiful and the colors throughout the movie are very vivid and fun. A worthy spectacle to watch with family, friends or even to enjoy alone.",7/10
"I loved Snow White. I think this movie was a disaster. She doesn't match the description of the iconic Disney character! Also the songs were terrible and I found myself not rooting for anyone but the 'Evil Queen'. The CGI dwarves were awful. Why not just create a new movie instead of ruining an American classic? If you all called it anything else I don't think people would have even made the connection, that's how far off the mark it is. How Disney is still in business is beyond me. I still remember how magical it felt hearing the Disney theme. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. Now I can't watch anything. Please stop ruining our favorites.",1/10
"The new live-action Snow White (2025) is yet another Disney disaster. In an attempt to modernize the story, the film stripped away all the charm of the classic, turning the protagonist into a dull and unlikable character. Rachel Zegler delivers a lifeless performance, while Gal Gadot, as the Evil Queen, seems more focused on striking poses than acting.

The decision to replace the seven dwarfs with digital creatures not only compromised representation but also made the film feel artificial and soulless. With generic visuals and an uninspired narrative, Snow White proves that not every story needs a remake-especially one as weak as this.",1/10

"I went into Snow White hoping for at least a decent adaptation, but this movie turned out to be an absolute train wreck. It fails on every level-storytelling, casting, visuals, and even basic entertainment value.

First off, the script is a mess. The film takes excessive liberties with the classic tale, stripping away its charm and replacing it with a dull, uninspired narrative that feels forced and preachy. The dialogue is laughably bad, making it impossible to take the characters seriously.

The casting choices are questionable at best. The lead performance lacks the warmth and charisma needed for the role, making it hard to connect with the character. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, delivering wooden performances that only add to the film's lack of emotional depth.

Visually, the movie looks like a cheap CGI overload. Instead of bringing the fairy tale to life, the effects look artificial and unconvincing, making scenes feel lifeless rather than magical. Even the costume and set designs fail to impress, looking uninspired and generic.

To top it off, the pacing is horrendous. The film drags in some parts and rushes through others, making it feel both boring and incoherent at the same time. Any attempt at humor falls flat, and there's no real sense of adventure or wonder-just a long, tedious experience that leaves you checking the time.

Overall, Snow White is an absolute disaster. It's an insult to the original story, a waste of talent, and a complete failure in filmmaking. Save yourself the time and skip this one.",1/10
"The acting was lackluster, failing to deliver any real depth or emotion. The story was even worse, with a weak plot that didn't capture the charm or intrigue of the original. To make matters worse, the music was unbearable, and it actually detracted from the experience rather than enhancing it. The original film was beloved for good reason, and this sequel decided to take the story in a completely different direction-one that, unfortunately, didn't pay off. It fell flat, and rightfully so. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Another thing the writer has to remember that this movie is for children and that it should have a positive out look on love not a dark one.",1/10
"I knew this movie was going to be bad. The idea of supporting Disney's lack of creativity and bastardization of a classic tale made me sick. Unfortunately, I was dragged against my will. This movie didn't meet my already low expectations. I make this statement genuinely; there is not ONE thing I enjoyed about this movie. It was completely and wholly bad. The acting was bad, the music was bad, the story was bad, the casting couldn't have been worse. I can't imagine liking any aspect of this movie. It watches like it was made for 6 year olds and I don't think they would enjoy it. Please take my word for it and don't go supporting this made-by-committee movie. Walt Disney is rolling in his grave right now.",1/10
"Absolutely terrible. This movie is a complete disaster from start to finish. The writing is shallow, the acting is wooden, and the visuals-while clearly expensive-feel soulless and overproduced. It's a hollow attempt at modernizing a classic, stripping away everything that made the original magical. The characters are unrecognizable, the story is butchered, and the forced messaging is painfully obvious. Anyone who gave this film 4 stars or more should seriously reconsider reviewing movies altogether. A 1-star rating is generous for this trainwreck of a remake that completely misses the heart and charm of the original tale.",1/10
"I watched this yesterday with my kids, and it was a complete disappointment. The acting was unconvincing, the CGI was subpar, the script was weak, and the songs were utterly forgettable. It felt like a wasted opportunity to create something truly magical.

The so-called ""Evil"" Queen didn't seem evil at all-just petty and jealous of Snow White's looks, lacking any real menace.

As for Snow White, her performance felt overly theatrical and unnatural, making it hard to connect with her character. The supposed romance between her and Prince Charming was completely unconvincing, with no real chemistry to make it believable.",1/10
"After My 1st Viewing of Snow White the Words I am Coming to with My 1st showing of the Film is; CHARMING, ENCOURAGING & CHARACTER EVOLVING! 🙂🍎

This new version Of Snow White is not about stupid buzz words you hear about online to put it down. Alot is charming character evolution, especially in Snow White herself!

A journey of acceptance of who one need to be as long as you have the courage & its hard to come by. All the music was fantastic in Snow White! But my favorite song definitely has to be Whistle While You Work!

That was just on another level of catchy, charming & a blast of fun!

Rachel Ziegler is the powerhouse, the central focus of the film many have already stated! She carries a film that is already great. The strength of her scenes either by herself or with others is impressive Her Snow White centrally is about overwhelming charm of caring & love! A GREAT Film!🏰👏

GREATLY Recommend Snow White!",8/10

"I thought it was not possible to do worse after titles such as The Little Mermaid, Pinocchio, Peter pan, which fortunately, at least the last two, were not in the cinema. A film with a villain bordering on the ridiculous, a protagonist who, to say the least, is ill-tempered and know-it-all, topped off by songs whose lyrics we cannot remember even after hearing them, make this film a disastrous representation of a classic that certainly did not deserve such a fate. Quite apart from the fact that even if it had not been called Snow White it would still have been a poorly made and badly acted film with holes in the screenplay certainly due to the constant twists and turns that affected the production, in order to save what can be saved, it unfortunately cannot be saved.",1/10
"The movie could have been interesting, the whole spin on the classic is a cool idea and if it was executed correctly it would have possibly been brilliant. But no, sadly whilst Snow White herself has a beautiful singing voice, Gal Gadot was truly terrible and those CGI non-dwarves were just creepy.

You could tell it had a lot of money spent on it, but it could have just been kept simple - great actors and a good storyline. That's really all that was needed.

The whole storyline was ridiculous and they crushed the story into irreparable pieces. Genuinely the worst film I've seen in the past 10 years.",1/10
"One if the worse movies I ever seen.

Portrayal of Snow White is unremarkable, offering a character devoid of depth or charm. Gal Gadot's depiction of the Evil Queen is equally disappointing and very poor acting! It comes off as flat, awkward, and just forced. Gadot's performance feels more like a bad cosplay of a villain, like she was reading off the script and no acting involved. And the song was just awful! Her voice was extremmly dull. In my opinion Gal Gadot's casting as the Evil Queen is one of the worst misfires in Disney history.

Plus CGI for the seven dwarfs was very unappealing.

If this movie will be remembered for anything, it will be as an example of how not to cast and direct.",1/10
"When Disney decided to make a modern ""Snow White,"" they wanted to produce a contemporary adaptation of one of its cherished classic princess films that would appeal to everyone. Instead of enhancing the story, it strips away everything that made the original special leaving this poisoned apple of a film that is devoid of the life and magic of the original.

The dopey artistic and effects choices made in this version won't make anyone happy, either. There was too much singing and not enough storytelling leading to a rather tedious experience.

While some musical numbers show potential, they are overly produced, which can detract from the authenticity of the performances. Rachel's impressive vocal talent, particularly evident in ""Spellbound,"" illustrates this point. It appears that in some instances, the focus on production has overshadowed the importance of crafting a film that truly connects with audiences.

Additionally, the film appears to fall short of its potential, resembling a production more similar to a made-for-TV movie. Disney seems to be facing challenges in effectively leveraging computer-generated effects, in contrast to the proficiency demonstrated by other studios, leading to an approach that prioritizes quantity over quality.

This Snow White is not the fairest of them all!",1/10
"Venturing off the original story was a huge mistake and the acting was completely horrible. Failing to even capture my the attention of my daughters who asked to leave cause it was putting them to sleep. So sad the remake was such a classic and to disgrace it like that. I noticed that there was way more singing than was necessary. The movie felt completely rushed getting through what should've been the original story line to fit with the new story line and it just took away from the fun, charismatic energy of the original. I just hope for the next remake they seriously learn from their mistakes or just re release the original classics in theaters for their anniversaries. That might help keep them from losing more money.",1/10
"I'm not even sure how to rate or review such a pathetic, misled attempt at remaking a legendary movie... suffice to say, save your money, stay home, and watch the original OG classic - this movie bears little resemblance to anything familiar or meaningful and will quickly be forgotten. I am sorry to say that Disney really missed the mark this time. The sad attempt to reimagine Snow White as a spunky, self-actualized Girl Boss simply falls flat. Defying the original premise of romance and fantasy was a huge misstep as literally no one cares about the heroine as a newly realized Womyn rather than a lovely romantic princess. I don't know why Disney can't see that sometimes it's best to leave well enough alone. In this case: Acting, directing, script, casting, concept = F-",1/10
"I have one word to describe it. Terrible.

Utter waste of time and money. Whoever came up with this needs their head testing. Worst remake ever. So t waste your time, your kids time, your families time or anyone else's for that matter. You'd be better off watching paint dry or water evaporate. Take them money you'd spend to watch this and flush it down the toilet which is where this diabolical shambles should be. If you want to watch it to ""give it fair try"", then you're stupid. Go and watch the original. And if your kids don't like the original, then you've failed them.

Had to rate it 1 star because sadly that's as low as you can go otherwise it would've got a zero star rating from me.",1/10
"Disappointed by the Casting - A Ruined Childhood Favorite

I was honestly heartbroken by this Snow White adaptation. The casting choice for the main character was incredibly poor and completely missed the essence of what Snow White represents. It felt like no effort was made to preserve the spirit of the original character - gentle, kind, and full of wonder.

This movie turned one of my most cherished childhood memories into something unrecognizable. Instead of honoring the classic story, it felt like they were trying to replace it with a hollow, modern version that lacked heart and soul. I left feeling more frustrated than nostalgic. It's such a shame to see a beloved fairytale treated this way.",1/10
"First, all the low scores coming before it opened are haters. I was excited and nervous going into this movie since the original means so much to me. Disney did a great job of bringing the kingdom to life and providing some additional storylines between the evil queen and Prince Charming and his bandits. The dwarfs are well animated regardless of how it appears in photographs. It felt nostalgic with my childhood and especially loved the added character elements they brought to my favorite dwarf, Dopey. The one main downfall: Gal Gadot continues to prove she can't act her way out of a paper bag.",8/10
"It's a sad day when the most interesting character is the non-moving Magic Mirror on the wall. Snow White was pretty bland and the sorceress queen is so flat you can't believe she's not more menacing. It would've been great for the story had the actors in this film cared to give it a little more personality, but to no avail this film looked beautiful on the surface, but was so bland as a Snow White live action fil could have been more fun to watch. The dwarves and their minds of precious jewels was probably second to the interesting mirror mirror on the wall. I hope someday somebody makes another snow White movie that has a better storyline and more convincing actors.",7/10
"It is sad that a generation of children have had their movies battered from pillar to post by the culture wars by a generation of entitled moral preachers. Is it any wonder that they would rather play on their iPads than go to the cinema?

Multiple ret-conning makes Snow White the hero of her own movie, presumably to inspire a new generation of young girls, however in order the be inspired in the first place they will have to get over the gaudy visuals.

The visuals are ani-human, the CGI Dwarves, for example, would be better off in some version of a Lovecraftian horror flick and Gal Gadot would be better of... just at home.

If Disney really hates itself this much maybe it should just write some original movies.",1/10
"I only wish I had less stars to give. Everything about this movie was completely unlikable: the script, the actors, the messaging, even the dark take on an old classic. Why Disney, why? Just make great movies without creepy snot nosed actors, and we'll give you all of our money. I had hoped the buzz was wrong, but nope! Bad, bad, bad! How on earth could you select Rachel Zegler to be anywhere near a Disney flick? Even Gal Gadot could not rescue this dung pile from the trash heap of cinematic history. If you have kids, spare them the agony, boredom and torture. Stay home and watch the classic. Barf!!",1/10
"Need to be seriously braindead to enjoy this slop. I genuinely didn't think Disney could butcher a classic this badly, but here we are. The new Snow White is an unholy combination of uninspired writing, baffling creative choices, and a complete misunderstanding of what made the original beloved. And don't even get me started on the visuals. The forest scenes look like they were filmed on a green screen in someone's garage, with animals so fake they make The Lion King remake look like a masterpiece. The costumes are somehow even worse-Snow White's iconic dress has been turned into a cheap, washed-out cosplay that looks like it was thrown together at the last minute.",1/10
"Dunno where to start. I stayed in the cinema until the end because i was fascinated by the mediocrity.

The story is inexistant, the entire cast can't be saved by the average performance of Gadot.

The effects are just totally outdated -btw, why are the dwarves cgi ?

Music is terrible, nothing in this movie has to be saved, huge waste of time.

I really thought it would never be possible to compete with Hercules in NY, but somehow they did it. I can't find any excuse for wasting spectators time like this - any snow white movie is better than this one, those have at least some original ideas...",1/10
"Wow. Just wow. I walked into the theater hoping for a fresh take on a classic fairytale and left wondering if the writers had even read the original story. This new Snow White is less a movie and more a two-hour TED Talk wrapped in a painfully awkward musical.

The dialogue feels like it was written by a group chat full of marketing interns trying to be ""empowering"" without understanding character depth. Snow White herself is a charisma vacuum-wooden delivery, zero chemistry with anyone, and about as enchanting as a cold cup of tea. The dwarves? Barely there. And not a single one had a personality beyond ""background extra with a name.""

The CGI looks like it was outsourced to a laptop from 2006, and don't get me started on the songs. One of them rhymed ""dream"" with ""scream"" and honestly, that was fitting. I was screaming internally.

This movie tries so hard to be modern and subversive, it forgets to be good. Disney, please stop digging up old classics just to reanimate them into lifeless cash grabs. Let them rest.

1 star. Only because the popcorn was decent.",1/10
I tried to keep an open mind but was surprised by how awkward this movies is. The acting wasn't genuine and the movie as a whole seemed forced. Huge fail for Disney and was a missed opportunity to remind us how they use to whisk us away once upon a time. The story is nothing like the original and doesn't captivate the audience at all. There is no feeling of escape from reality and felt like a really bad TV show that I paid so much money to see. The CGI was not realistic and did not fit with the rest of the movie. Why didn't they just use real actors. The silver lining is the music which I give Disney a lot of credit for.,1/10
"Disney's live-action Snow White is a complete disaster from start to finish. Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is uninspired, lacking the warmth and charm that made the original character beloved. She delivers her lines with little emotion, and her portrayal feels more like a rebellious teenager than a fairy tale princess.

The film's attempt to modernize the story falls flat, stripping away the classic romance and replacing it with a dull, uninspired narrative. The CGI dwarfs are unconvincing and awkward, making the movie visually unappealing. Even Gal Gadot, who should have been a highlight as the Evil Queen, is wasted in a role that fails to bring any real menace or intrigue.

The new songs are forgettable, the dialogue feels forced, and the overall tone of the movie is a confused mess. Disney's obsession with remaking its animated classics continues to prove that not every story needs a live-action adaptation. This Snow White is neither magical nor memorable, just another unnecessary cash grab.

Sticks to the original.",1/10
"Hollywood has officially run out of ideas, and this new Snow White remake is proof. Instead of honoring the timeless charm of the original, this film strips away everything that made it special, replacing it with forced modern messaging, lackluster performances, and a complete misunderstanding of its own source material.

First, let's talk about the obvious-this was never a movie that needed a remake. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is a classic that set the foundation for Disney's golden age of animation. It was beautifully animated, had iconic music, and, most importantly, heart. This version, on the other hand, is a bland, CGI-heavy mess with none of the magic.

The casting choices and script changes feel more like a marketing stunt than an attempt to tell a good story. The removal of key elements (like the dwarfs) and the rewriting of Snow White's character into something completely unrecognizable only further prove that the filmmakers had no real interest in staying true to the fairy tale. Instead of an innocent, kind-hearted princess, we now get a modernized, independent warrior who looks down on the original story. And let's be honest-if you don't respect the source material, why even bother remaking it?

The visuals are another disappointment. Despite Disney's massive budget, the CGI looks lifeless, and the costume designs are forgettable at best. The film lacks the handcrafted beauty of the animated original and instead feels like yet another generic, over-processed live-action attempt that no one really asked for.

Disney used to be about storytelling. Now, it's about ticking boxes and making headlines. This movie isn't about nostalgia or bringing a classic to a new generation-it's about using a beloved brand to push a half-baked modern narrative while cashing in on a known IP.

At the end of the day, this Snow White remake is unnecessary, uninspired, and utterly forgettable. If you love the original, do yourself a favor-skip this movie and rewatch the 1937 masterpiece instead.",1/10
"After all the hate out there for this movie, I wasn't really sure what to expect. I am glad I went to see it for myself to form my own opinions, and I encourage you to do the same. I loved the nostalgia of some of the original songs but equally enjoyed the new songs which help to modernize it. Snow White was able to fight for her kingdom and become the leader they deserved while still finding love in a way that didn't seemed forced. I'm excited to see it again. I didn't find the CGI offensive at all, and found the dwarves to be quite charming. If I had to pick a weak point, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, it is Gal's musical numbers. Her voice just isn't there, and she is what I was the most excited for. She's definitely the fairest in the land though!",9/10
"I wish one day disney decides to do a Snow white movie the RIGHT way.. and do Lana Parrilla as the Evil Queen and Jenna Ortega as Snow White

now that would be truly epic.

As for this movie.

I know this review will get thumbs down .. but hey it's fine with me i'm not rolling with the hate train, half the people putting reviews here didn't even watched the movie and just go with the hate train.

Is this movie a 10\10 ? No... it's flat. The acting is flat, the cgi dwarfs are wierd, it's borig at times, and it's not as good as it could have been .

Is it a 1/10 movie ? Absulotely not.

Rachel has good stuff and bad stuff to her bad: -she is a not a good person OUTSIDE of the camera, she bad mouth Gal, the movie, and disney which effects how much you can love her as snow white -her acting is flat good: -she has a great voice -i personaly think she looks good, i know many think she's ugly but i dont see it i think she looks great.

-she is decent actor. Not good but decent.

Gal also has bad and good to her bad: -she cannot sing, her songs were autotune a lot.

-her acting is very flat as the evil queen it's not her best role.

Good: -she is drop dead beautiful -again her acting is decent it's not bad.

Yea they could do a lot more with Lana Parila (the one that playd the evil queen in once upon a time) and with Jenna Ortega (wensday from the adams family 'wensday' series on netflix) as snow white.

They could add some comedy to the evil queen not kept it so boring

add some nice creativity to the story, scenes, songs, have better director for the songs

they could have talked to the fans..... disney never talks to the fans..

they could have made this a 12/10 movie instead they made this

which is not bad it's def not a 1/10 movie

but it's a great 6/10 movie and you know what ?

I saw a little girl 5yo dressed as snow white in the cinema... yesterday she had the TIIME OF HER LIFE

for her she didn't care about Rachel outside the screens... for her.. it was just a magical movie about a princess.

That little girl would never see the 1937 original movie otherwise

so for her i gave it 1 more point making it a 7-10 movie.",7/10
"This movie is an absolute disappointment on all fronts. The rendition is painfully poor, with lackluster acting and characters that fail to evoke any emotion or connection. The performances are flat, and the personalities portrayed are uninspiring and forgettable. Even children, who are often more forgiving of animated or lighthearted content, have expressed how terrible they found it.

While it's true that some children may have the chance to watch this movie, unfortunately, a lot don't.

The experience leaves much to be desired, and it's hard to imagine anyone enjoying or benefiting from it.

Frankly, it's not worth your time or money.

Save yourself the disappointment and look elsewhere for something that respects your time and attention.",1/10

They were so confused as to why snow white looked like a cleaning lady at the hotel and not a pretty lady like the wicked witch was... Do not recommend this movie to anyone, waste of time and money. Disney needs to really do better with these kids movies, They are ruining a good thing and that is very very sad.... This movie felt like it was mad with a AI bot on X, We are very sad with this movie, The worst movie we have ever seen in the theaters.",1/10
"Shallow plot with competing directions delivered by poor acting and awkward CGI characters. Previews remakes were able to give the serious and/or fun twist that a live-action requires. This one is just a boring mess: it is not funny at all, and it is not serious enough to generate any reaction.

It is really unfortunate to Walt Disney legacy, if you consider that Snow White was the first animated movie released by the studio, celebrated in all cruises. It should have been a tribute to the history of Disney, and let's just hope that it can be the reset button to make Disney great again, don't you agree?",1/10
"The 2025 Snow White remake is a disappointment. It trades storytelling for heavy-handed themes and forgets to make us care about the characters. The dialogue feels forced, the humor falls flat, and the emotional moments lack impact. Even with a bigger budget and modern effects, it lacks the magic and charm that made the original memorable. Instead of reinventing the fairy tale, it strips it down to a dull, joyless experience. A missed opportunity from start to finish, leaving little reason to revisit or recommend.

Hopefully this kind of movies will be a lesson for the future moviemakers in the industry.",1/10
"Painful. Just painful. My 14-year-old daughter said it was the hardest movie to watch in her lifetime. I agree. Gal Gadot is not a good actress. That's no secret. Did you also know she can't sing? Now you do! We went on a Sunday afternoon of opening weekend. There were probably 20 people in the entire movie theater. Word has clearly gotten out. But, I try not to listen to reviews, and we went anyway. I regret my decision. I can't find anything redeeming about this movie. Some have said that the actress who played Snow White did a good job, but, I don't feel that way. All of the acting was just bland. Walt would be ashamed.",1/10

"I had high hopes for the 2025 ""Snow White,"" but it turned out to be one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in a long time. What should have been a magical reimagining of a beloved classic turned into a drawn-out slog that left me checking my watch more than once.

The writing was painfully lackluster, filled with cringeworthy dialogue that felt more like a series of cliché catchphrases than genuine conversation. The plot meandered endlessly, lacking the charm and coherence that made the original so endearing. The awkward pacing made it hard to connect with any of the characters, particularly Snow White, who came off as bland and forgettable.

As for the cast, despite some commendable performances, they were working with very little. The dwarves, often the heart of the story, were reduced to caricatures, losing any semblance of depth or personality. Meanwhile, the villain was diminished to a mere shadow of her former self-more annoying than threatening.

Visually, while the film showcased some impressive scenery and effects, they often felt overused and distracting rather than enhancing the story. Instead of immersing us in the fairy tale world, it felt like a flashy cover hiding an empty shell.

Overall, the 2025 ""Snow White"" is a disappointing and forgettable attempt to revive a classic. If you're a fan of the original tale, do yourself a favor and skip this version. It's a shame to see such a rich story miss the mark so profoundly.",1/10
"Boy never thought I'd have to say that about a Disney movie.

The only reason I'm writing a review is because I know there's going to be a ton a negativity here so trying to show the other side.

The beginning was a bit of a slog to get through; it was pretty sugary. Yes we know she had a wonderful family and everyone loved everyone else and then Mom died and Dad picked a terrible second wife. Blah blah blah But for all those rumors swirling about how Snow doesn't need a Prince apparently that didn't mean they weren't going to give us a male hero...in this iteration he's more or less a Robin Hood kind of guy. Kind of vanilla but it's a princess movie, right ?

The dwarves were a LOT to get past but you do actually get used to the weird CGI (not quite as creepy as the Polar Express) and they play their parts well enough.

Ludicrous that Disney used CGI for the Seven Dwarves and then in the next bit of the film there is an actual little person (can't say dwarf or Peter Dinklage will get mad🙄) who gets more character development than any of the Seven do.

Snow herself is very sweet but I can see for kids she would have her charm. The Evil Queen is a scenery chewing Gal Gadot, channeling her inner Joan Crawford in an interesting flip from her usual heroic roles. (be prepared --- she sings!! Very trashy and lots of fun) There's a lot of echoes from other films here, but as someone who has seen the original on the big screen (in a rerelease back in the 70s) and loved it for decades I can say this version is quite enjoyable. Was it necessary? No Is it vintage Disney? No Did it come out too close to Wicked? Yes!!!

Will you like it?

I don't know.

This was the movie that started it all, so I do wish it was BETTER . It's going to be in regular viewing rotation as soon as it hits Disney plus, so it's kind of nice to see it on the big screen.

Give it a shot, at least.",8/10

"I don't understand why Disney insists on ruining our classic movies. If you want to remake something, at least respect the original story and improve it with better visuals, performances, or effects-not by changing the core narrative. If you have a new story to tell, then create a fresh character, a new movie, and give it a different name.

Use your creativity, but don't ruin our movies. Classics are classics for a reason!!!

Disney has a habit of ruining classics. Mulan (2020) for example. Fans were deeply disappointed with a Rating of 3/10. Another disappointing adaptation was The Little Mermaid (2023) with a Rating of 4/10.

Please stop!!!",1/10
"I appreciate new meanings Disney tries to discover. But when it comes to a classic fairytale, please don't push me ideas, especially not very logical.

This should be a light family show, not a art-house picture combining bad acting, bad CGI and scenario.

I believe Gal Gadot always wanted to play this role, but she was trapped. This base tale is used in many other movies, and without the ""Snow White"" title everyone understands similarity but can take a new look of the old tale. Still, everyone keeps the original tale in the heart with love and nostalgia notes.

From the psychology point of view, that's a story of narcissism and psychopathy, and I wish we will see this interpretation without any side (strange) ideas.",1/10
"Sad to say the ""Someday my princess will come"" is not part of the movie itself. Remove Two songs that signifies Snow white. Why remove the song, why not just add but don't remove the song that specifically portray Snow White.

I wish they learn from their mistakes, specifically in the earlier times many people against on it after the casting of the roles, but they still continue it despite of the reaction of the people.

Casting different actor to fit in a role in a movie feels like you forcing to fit it butbit isnt, it can be not a good result. I can say changes is good but is not always a good thing though.",1/10
This movie serves no purpose to even be associated with Snow White. If you're just going to completely change a character...just make a new character. Horrible movie. Desecrating a national treasure is by far the lowest of the low that Disney has gone. Walt is rolling in his grave right now. I'm surprised that they even had the gull to premier this movie to avoid the pending humiliation and lasting negative impression it will leave among Snow White fans. I think this will create a domino effect among future Disney films and set the precedent of how people will critique the reimagined classics from this point forward.,1/10
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is less a fairytale and more a cautionary tale-about how not to remake a beloved classic. Clocking in at 1 hour and 49 minutes, this film manages to feel twice as long, thanks to its lifeless pacing, bland dialogue, and performances that barely register on the emotional scale.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks warmth and wonder, coming off more like a disinterested motivational speaker than the charming heroine we remember. Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen? Stunning to look at, sure-but about as menacing as a slightly annoyed librarian. The magic? Gone. The whimsy? MIA. The dwarfs? Reduced to a forgettable footnote.",1/10
"Problem with this movie is that it takes a name from very well known and likable story and changes whole perspective and vision to something very bad implemented. They should have made new movie, new name, dont even call it Snow White but on the other hand this without famous name would never landed in theaters. Actors are not that bad, its not a top class but more like series B actors. Even G. Gadot (with all respect as i really like her in many other movies) was not convincing in her performance. Zegler have still much to learn, i think this was not a role for her, i belive it may not help her with a future career. Its simple friday night netflix movie that you watch and instant forget. I guess Disney just likes loosing money, well just skip this movie not worth spending money on it...",2/10
"Truly terrible. I really hated this not only because it is unimaginative - but it is just boring!

It's as if the creators had no interest in pushing boundaries or even delivering the bare minimum of engagement. Every scene drags on without purpose, the dialogue is uninspired, and the pacing is so sluggish that even moments meant to build tension feel lifeless. There's no creativity in the cinematography, no spark in the performances, and certainly no effort in the storytelling.

The film doesn't just fail to be entertaining-it actively drains any enthusiasm you might have had going in. It's the kind of experience that makes you check your watch repeatedly, hoping for an end that never seems to come soon enough.",1/10

I am disappointed they didn't have dwarf actors, but I understand the issues that had surrounding that- you can't please everybody.

"I wasn't expecting much after hearing and reading the reviews surrounding Snow White but I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the movie. Yes it has some modern twists but still followed the main parts of the original story line just with more added in. Enjoyed all the songs and loved the severn dwarfs. The acting was ok nothing to shout about but not terrible. If you can view the movie as a modern Snow White tale and not be stuck on it not being identical to the original, it's perfectly watchable. I personally don't think it deserves the backlash it's getting and would say it's worth a watch.",7/10
"The 2025 Snow White movie is a complete letdown, failing to capture the magic of the original 1937 Disney classic. While the idea of reimagining such an iconic tale had potential, the final product falls short in almost every way.

Story & Plot: The plot itself is uninspired, offering little more than a dull retelling of the original story. While the 1937 version was groundbreaking, enchanting, and full of heart, this 2025 version misses the mark. It lacks the charm, the emotional depth, and the timeless appeal that made the original Snow White so memorable. The story feels rushed and shallow, with key moments that should have felt emotional or dramatic falling flat. It's a forgettable experience rather than a captivating reimagining.

The Lead Actor: Perhaps the biggest issue with this Snow White is the casting. The main actor simply does not fit the role. Snow White is supposed to be innocent, charming, and full of life-but in this version, the actor feels out of place. There's no warmth or connection with the audience. She fails to evoke the same tenderness and strength that made the 1937 Snow White a beloved character. It's hard to care about her journey when her portrayal feels so disconnected from the essence of the character.

Comparing to the 1937 Classic: It's clear that the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a far superior film. That version, with its groundbreaking animation and heartfelt storytelling, has remained a timeless classic for a reason. This 2025 retelling lacks the warmth, depth, and enchantment that made the original such a success. The performances were strong in 1937, with each character bringing something unique and memorable. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for this modern version.

Conclusion: In short, the 2025 Snow White is a disappointing attempt at reviving a beloved classic. The story is flat, the lead actor is miscast, and it simply doesn't do justice to the original 1937 film. For anyone looking to relive the magic of Snow White, it's best to stick with the 1937 version, which remains the definitive and much more enjoyable take on the tale. I hope this movie won raspberry movie award for worst movie ever.",1/10
"I can't believe how badly Disney's Snow White 2025 turned out. As a fan of the original classic, I was expecting a fresh, thoughtful retelling, but instead, I was left with a complete disappointment. This film was a waste of both my time and money.

The most glaring issue for me was the character of Snow White herself. Instead of being the strong, iconic figure she was in the original, she was reduced to a joke. Gone was the grace and depth that made her memorable. Instead, she was written as a clumsy, uninspiring character with no real substance. Her portrayal was not only disappointing but downright cringeworthy at times, making it hard to take the film seriously. The way they handled her role felt more like a parody than a reimagining of the beloved princess.

The performances across the board were underwhelming. Despite the film's star-studded cast, the acting was flat, and the chemistry between the characters felt forced. The dwarfs, instead of being endearing, felt awkward and out of place, and the film's attempt at humor fell painfully short.

Visually, the movie had some moments of impressive CGI, but even that couldn't mask the film's lack of heart. The effects felt overdone, and the magical elements didn't evoke the wonder they should have. The pacing was slow, and the plot was uninspired. The film didn't add anything meaningful to the classic story-it just tried to cash in on nostalgia without understanding why the original was so special.

Overall, Snow White 2025 is a prime example of a remake that misses the mark in every way. Instead of honoring the character of Snow White, it reduces her to a punchline, and the rest of the film follows suit. I strongly regret spending my money and time on this film. It's a major disappointment, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1/10
"If I realized this movie was going to eat up 2 hours of my life for nothing, I'd have bailed before the opening credits. The plot was exhausting- convoluted and stale, and it didn't even try to honour the original story. I went in hoping for a clever reimagining, but it's just a jumbled mess with over the top visuals and a storyline that feels desperate to be relevant but misses by a mile. They could have made a new movie with this plot instead of completely disgracing the cartoon.

I will say that Zegler's got an incredible voice, but her acting seems stiff- as if she's trying to sell the empowerment angle too hard.",1/10
"The only thing I would rescue from the film would be the songs, it is something fresh but they are not songs that mark or move. The excessive cgi with the dwarves was bizarre to me, it didn't fit. It's like if you cut an image out of a magazine and pasted it over an oil on canvas, it looks dire. The plot on the other hand, I understand that they wanted to create an empowered character and get out of the traditional story, however, the development of Snow White's character was so poor that instead of looking like an empowered woman she looks more like a capricious woman, this version will not even be remembered in a year because the movie was so poorly developed due to the lack of creativity that they condemned it to the dumpster.",1/10
"Disney's latest take on Snow White is, quite simply, a baffling mess. From the moment the film begins, it's clear that creativity, effort, and even basic storytelling have taken a backseat. If you're looking for stunning visuals or a compelling narrative, look elsewhere-because what you'll find here is a film that feels uninspired, rushed, and painfully cringeworthy.

The graphics? Subpar. The writing? Lazy. The charm and magic Disney was once known for? Nowhere to be found. Instead, Snow White serves up a bland, lifeless experience that drains any excitement you might have had going in. If you're hoping for a modernized twist on a classic, prepare for disappointment. If you're simply looking to kill time, be warned-you may end up feeling even more bored than when you started.

Disney has lost its spark, and Snow White is proof that its golden age of storytelling may be long gone.",1/10
"Rachel Zegler lacks emotional depth, talent, and personality to portray the legendary Snow White. Her performance feels uninspired, flat, and utterly soulless-a huge casting blunder.

The CGI dwarfs are overly creepy and artificial, feeling like a major mistake.

The forced rewrites of several aspects of the plot are too contrived and unbelievable. It's fine to try a different twist on the original story, but the final result is a messy collection of semi-justice-educating moments and dull scenes that lead nowhere.

The only redeeming quality of this movie is the surprising role of Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, but even that couldn't save this horrendous remake, which should never have been made.",1/10
So disappointed... my favorite Disney movie and they failed miserably. There were so many options for a better Snow White. I have never heard of the girl who played her but the acting was horrible. It felt like a low budget film with very low budget acting... hope one day it'll be re made again with a better cast. She might do better in a different film but this was just not it. I also wish they followed the original story line of the Disney show white. Oh well. I wasn't a fan of the costumes either. I don't know why but it just gave off creepy vibes. Not at all what I imagined. With the money that was spent on the film they could have done so much better.,1/10
"*Snow White 2025* is a trainwreck, and the lead actress is the conductor. Snow White herself has all the energy of a wet blanket. Watching her is like seeing someone read a grocery list with no emotion. The queen should be jealous, but honestly, it's hard to even care when Snow White's performance is as lifeless as her character. It's like they found the one person who could make a poisoned apple seem more exciting than her scenes. Modernizing the story? Sure, but you might want to start by casting someone who can actually act. The queen is supposed to be jealous of this particular Snow White? Ok bud.",1/10
"I took my 5yo, my 11yo, my partner, and my mom and everyone had a great time and talked about it for days. The kids want to listen to the soundtrack at every opportunity.

Honestly, as a kids' movie, I don't think my or other adult opinions really matter. That said, I can't resist, so... The updates were pretty good, Gal Gadot was incredible, the animated animals were some of my favorite characters. I didn't love the Dopey update, but the Dwarves were really fun overall. I was never a fan of ""true love's kiss"" but they didn't manage to get rid of that *shrug*. All in all, a very well made movie with a fun and engaging cast.",8/10

"The acting in this film leaves much to be desired, as many performances feel flat and unconvincing, failing to bring the characters to life in a meaningful or engaging way. The emotional depth that made the original so compelling is largely absent, making it difficult to connect with the characters on any level. One of the most jarring aspects of this adaptation is the CGI dwarves, which are not only unsettling but outright terrifying. Their artificial, almost uncanny appearance makes them difficult to take seriously and significantly detracts from the overall viewing experience. Instead of enhancing the story, the CGI feels out of place and distracting, pulling focus away from the narrative and breaking immersion at key moments. The decision to use CGI in this way ultimately does a disservice to the film, making it feel more like an animated feature than a live-action adaptation. What made the original so special was its charm, warmth, and the authenticity of its characters, but much of that has been stripped away in favor of a visually flashy but emotionally hollow experience. The heart of the story seems to have been lost in the process, replaced with a cold, artificial aesthetic that fails to capture the magic and wonder of the original. Instead of feeling like a loving tribute or a fresh take, this version comes across as a misguided attempt to modernize something that never needed changing in the first place.",1/10
"I desperately wanted to enjoy the new ""Snow White"" movie-I gave it every chance, more than it deserved. But it's utter rubbish, a contender for the worst of the worst. My kids, who know the classic tale inside out, were left baffled by this convoluted mess. Trying to explain the bizarre plot twists and deviations only deepened their confusion-how do you even screw up something this simple? The acting is lifeless, the CGI dwarfs are a nightmare, and the script feels like it was scribbled by someone who hates fairy tales. It's not just bad; it's spectacularly bad, a masterclass in butchering a beloved story. How does a studio greenlight this garbage? Avoid it at all costs-it's a soulless, confusing disaster that insults kids and adults alike.",1/10
"This film is awful! The visuals feel uninspired, with CGI that looks more dated than dazzling, and the script is a dull, lifeless retread of better adaptations. The emotional beats fall flat, and the attempts at modernizing the story come off as forced rather than fresh. Even the lead performance struggles to shine amid awkward pacing and poorly written dialogue.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen wasn't just disappointing - it was downright painful. Her performance felt more like a bored celebrity cameo than a menacing, iconic villain. Every line delivery was stiff and lifeless, making it impossible to take her seriously.

Instead of the regal, terrifying presence we expected, we got awkward smirks and a flat, fashion-model-gone-bad vibe. No depth, no menace - just a face doing a bad impression of a villain.

This movie was a disaster from start to finish, but Gadot's performance was the final nail in the coffin. A reimagining that no one asked for and even fewer will remember...",1/10
"Strays too far from the storyline. Updating to reduce aged stereotypes does not have change core of the story. Another Disney tale ruined in live action form. Does Disney not have any original ideas that can be developed, the retelling of the classics in a poorly thought out manner hurt both versions. Instead of removing Prince Charming, why not add him to the beginning and develop the characters before me Snow White goes to the forest.

The attacks on the cast are misguided. Casting is fine the storyline is the problem. Take the story, supplement, not change and add the musical elements to update, it's not rocket science.",1/10
"I went into Snow White (2025) hoping for a fresh take on a beloved classic, but what I got was an absolute mess. From the uninspired performances to the baffling creative choices, this movie fails on every level.

First, the script is unbearably dull, filled with lifeless dialogue and forced ""modern"" updates that strip away the charm of the original. The changes to the story feel unnecessary and out of place, turning an enchanting fairy tale into a preachy, joyless slog.

The casting is another major issue. The lead performance lacks charisma, making Snow White more annoying than endearing. The supporting characters are forgettable, and the film completely mishandles its interpretation of the dwarfs, replacing them with unmemorable stand-ins that add nothing to the story.

Visually, it's a mixed bag. While some of the CGI looks decent, many scenes feel overly artificial and uninspired. The costumes and set design are bland, failing to capture the magic of the original film. Even the musical numbers, which should be a highlight, are flat and unmemorable.

Overall, Snow White (2025) is a soulless cash grab that completely misses the heart of the story. Instead of celebrating a classic, it awkwardly tries to ""modernize"" it in all the wrong ways. Disney needs to stop with these lifeless remakes and start focusing on original storytelling again.

Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1/10
"This film was a waste of time, I can't think of anything positive to say.

I really can't think of anything positive to say about this film, I really am trying.

After all the backlash you would have thought they would have made some changes to this film.

Looking at some of the higher scores I think we saw different films. End of term day each to their own.

If you like a good story, good acting, good special effects, funny jokes/gags, good musical numbers. This film is not for you.

If you have about 2 hours free to kill and it's this or have to walk around in the rain then yeah I can understand why you might see this film.",1/10
"Disney is flat. It lacks imagination, it lacks inspiration, it lacks style.

Making another version of this huge and mesmerising classic turns out to be a waste of money and time.

It is not as bad as Cats (nothing can be that bad) but there's not the feeling you are watching and adventure or fairytale. You're watching a product instead. It feels like the longest commercial ever.

It lacks warmth and especially in the leading parts, you can see and feel that they act. No natural experiences, no burst of sympathy.

It's artificial. Like watching AI generated actors.

Not once do you really get ""into"" the adventure. You're a bystander, watching a terrible accident, created by a moneymaking machine.

It's about time that those who are responsible for turning the once delightful princess of the movie industry, Disney, into an evil witch, get fired.

Make Disney, make believe, again.",1/10
"This movie had so much negativity attached to it from the beginning. When this happens you really have to try and be extra, extra, extra positive and hope it ends up proving those people wrong.

Nope, this is not the movie that will do that.

With the budget allocated for this movie, you expect the CGI to be amazing, nope.

You expect the costumes to be stunning. Nope. It really came across as low budget for the majority, especially Snow Whites.

Even the performances from the big draw card of Gal was underwhelming.

The movie ventured mostly into tacky and cringe.

On the brightside, it can only be 'UP' for Disney after this one.",1/10
"It's so nice to be pleasantly surprised by a film!

I was not expecting to like this movie much - the original is a masterwork for its time, but is dated. If this version had been a shot-for-shot remake, it would have been a waste of time.

Instead, the filmmakers took the core of the story, made it accessible to today's audience, infused it with amazing original music and dance, and produced something I'd gladly see again with my grandchildren.

Gal Gadot gave a great performance, in all aspects. Rachel Zegler used her innocence, beauty and voice to embody a hero we can all love. Andrew Burnap was Robin Hood-esque in heroism and charm.

I am SO glad I didn't listen to the trolls.

And I would LOVE to get the soundtrack. What songs! As I watched, I kept thinking ""these remind me of 'The Greatest Showman'!"" And with good reason! The same songwriters!",8/10

When I watch this movie with my daughter I was expecting some of the memories that I shared with my daughters already about this movie like what's gonna happen next this movie has totally contradicted and I was so surprised and shocked that this is most insane and bizarre movie plot ever come across This is really disappointing for me and my family that story I was telling to my daughters my son since their childhood it's all ruined.",1/10
Horrible acting and just horrible movie overall. Wasted money sitting through this movie. I rather go watch the cartoon over this movie any day. Gal Gadot Was the worse of them all!!! She ruined the Wonder Woman movies and now ruined Snow White. I'm glad this movie was bust and people can save their money and not even worth streaming it when it comes out. Maybe if they had a better actress than Gal this movie could've been great. I hope she reads these reviews and understands she ruined a Disney classic with her horrible performance in this movie. They should've had Angelina Jolie over Gal. I would give it a 0 if I could.,1/10
"I can't explain how disappointing this movie was. Simply disappointing. What the hell was that?

From the moment the first teaser dropped, Snow White (2025) sparked controversy, and unfortunately, the final product only amplified concerns. The decision to modernize the narrative by removing the prince and altering the portrayal of the seven dwarfs was seen as a significant departure from the original. Many fans who grew up with Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) were left confused and frustrated. This wasn't just a simple retelling-it was a complete overhaul of a beloved classic, one that left little resemblance to the timeless fairy tale.

Characterization & Performances

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen? Not for me. Sure, she looked the part-elegant, regal, and strikingly beautiful-but her performance lacked the gravitas needed to make the Queen truly menacing. Instead of exuding the chilling menace of the animated version, Gadot's Evil Queen often felt like a watered-down villain, more style than substance. Her character's motivations felt hollow, and despite her attempts to bring a sense of theatricality, it all fell flat.

Then there's Snow White herself. Snow White (played by Rachel Zegler) is no longer the passive princess waiting for true love's kiss. Instead, she is reimagined as an independent, strong-willed leader who dreams of ruling her kingdom without needing a prince. While the idea of a self-sufficient heroine is admirable, the execution left much to be desired. Instead of a charming and kind-hearted princess, this version of Snow White comes off as detached and, at times, unlikable. Zegler's performance is serviceable, but it lacks the warmth and sincerity that made the original character so endearing.

The Evil Queen (Gal Gadot) remains obsessed with Snow White's beauty, but the central conflict is now more about power than romance. While modernizing a fairy tale isn't inherently a bad thing, the way it was handled here stripped the story of its emotional core. The original Snow White wasn't just about romance-it was about kindness, innocence, and resilience. This version of the story, however, feels like a forced attempt to be ""progressive"" at the expense of its heart.

One of the most controversial changes is the complete removal of Prince Charming. While Disney has been moving away from the ""damsel in distress"" trope in recent years, the decision to remove the prince altogether left many fans wondering why the film was even called Snow White. The prince's role in the original was small, but his presence was symbolic. Here, the omission feels less like an organic change and more like an attempt to distance itself from traditional fairy tale elements entirely.

Additionally, the seven dwarfs are no longer the beloved, unique characters from the original but are instead replaced by a group of diverse magical creatures. This change, meant to be more ""inclusive,"" ended up alienating audiences even further. Fans cherished the dwarfs not just because they were short but because they each had distinct personalities that added charm and humor to the story. Replacing them with generic magical creatures resulted in a loss of character depth and emotional connection.

Visuals & Direction

Visually, Snow White has some beautiful moments. The cinematography is colorful and grand, and the costume design is impressive. However, the CGI used for the magical creatures and backgrounds feels inconsistent, making some scenes look artificial rather than immersive. There are moments of visual spectacle, but they are overshadowed by jarring CGI work that pulls you out of the experience rather than drawing you in.

The film's pacing also suffers, with certain moments dragging while others feel rushed. Scenes that should have been impactful lack weight, and the story's flow feels choppy. Director Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man) tries to inject a modern sensibility into the film, but the result feels disjointed. Instead of a timeless fairy tale, Snow White often feels like a generic fantasy film with a familiar name slapped onto it for brand recognition.

Final Verdict

Snow White had the potential to be a fresh and exciting update to a beloved classic. Instead, it comes off as a misguided attempt to modernize a story that didn't need drastic changes. With weak character development, controversial creative choices, and a script that feels more like a checklist of modern themes than a cohesive narrative, Snow White ultimately fails to capture the magic of the original.

At its core, Disney's Snow White feels like a film that doesn't know who it's for. It alienates fans of the original, disappoints those who wanted an exciting retelling, and frustrates audiences who wanted something more than a hollow attempt at ""progressive"" storytelling. If you were looking forward to a nostalgic, heartwarming experience, you won't find it here.

Rating: 1/10

Unless you're a die-hard Disney fan curious to see the controversy firsthand, this is one fairy tale best left unwatched.",1/10
"I usually refrain from commenting in a negative way, but in this case it has to be said. It's a shallow, meaningless movie that is wrong in so many ways. Production and all. At the beginning, when it was announced, I was living in hope, but then Rachel Zegler came up with that incredibly cringe interview and I was shocked. I started watching the previews and I have to say, my initial enthusiasm grew colder and smaller. After watching not even half of it, I decided to go and do something else. What a disappointment. If you are curious I understand completely, but I would think twice before spending money on this.",1/10
"Disappointing and Lacking Magic This new ""Snow White"" adaptation feels utterly devoid of the charm and wonder of the original. The plot veers so far from the classic tale that it's barely recognizable, and the magic that should permeate a fairy tale is conspicuously absent. The pacing is sluggish, and the overall tone is surprisingly dull. Rachel Zegler's performance, while not inherently bad, is overshadowed by the pre-release controversy surrounding her comments, which unfortunately tainted the viewing experience. Ultimately, this film fails to capture the essence of Snow White, leaving a cold and unmagical impression.",1/10
"Ugh, Snow White. Where do I even begin? This movie is a saccharine, overlong slog. The premise is... questionable. A princess finds herself in a creepy forest and takes up residence with seven extremely loud and annoying housemates. The central conflict feels forced. The pacing is glacial, and the story struggles to maintain interest.

And let's talk about the romantic lead. He has the personality of a wet napkin. His grand romantic gesture? It's... certainly something. The animation, while groundbreaking for its time, is now dated and often unsettling. The songs are forgettable and repetitive, and the dialogue is clunky and exposition-heavy.

The supporting characters, intended for comic relief, are grating and one-dimensional. The antagonist's motivations are cartoonish and lack any real depth. The whole thing feels like a morality play hammered over your head with a sledgehammer. It's a classic, yes, but a classic that has not aged well. There are far better animated films out there, with more compelling characters, engaging stories, and less reliance on outdated tropes. This fairy tale is a relic, not a masterpiece.",1/10
"""Snow White"" is a cinematic disaster that I can't believe made it to the big screen. This film is a complete train wreck from start to finish. The acting is so painfully mediocre that even the trees seem to have more personality. The plot is a disjointed mess, with nonsensical twists that left me confused and frustrated. The special effects look like they were created in a high school art class, completely ruining any sense of magic. Snow White herself is unlikable and bland, making it impossible to care about her journey. The music is forgettable at best. Honestly, this film is an insult to fairy tales everywhere. Avoid it at all costs!

I recommend going back to 1937.",1/10
"As a lifelong fan of Disney classics, I was excited for this remake, but unfortunately, it fell flat.

"I am always apprehensive of any Disney live action adaptation but I was pleasantly surprised when I watched Snow White.

I hadn't realised this version would be more musical lead and enjoyed the additional songs by Pasek & Paul. I did have genuine goosebumps hearing the Dwarves' 'Heigh Ho' and 'Dig Dig Dig' on the big screen. Can we also appreciate just how adorable Dopey is?!

I watched on opening night in London and the families there clearly enjoyed it (a round of applause after the film, that, I didn't expect!!) seems like despite the negative press, the magic of Disney is still well and truly alive for those who went to see it.",7/10
"The dwarves were uncanny valley/difficult for suspension of disbelief.

The costumes felt like if you asked ChatGPT to make a colorful Disney scene, just off and the costume equivalent of too many fingers on one hand.

Gal Gadot? Not a Disney character. We thought that it was a joking part of the film when she began to sing, but quickly realized this was a genuine part of the film. Took us quite by surprise. The motions and expressions were forced and uncanny.

"The 2025 live-action Snow White tries to push progressive agendas, but it feels forced and detracts from the original's charm. Snow White, played by Rachel Zegler, is portrayed as more assertive and independent, while the film's attempt to reframe the Evil Queen's jealousy as a critique of societal beauty standards feels clumsy. The dwarfs are digitally altered to avoid using actors with dwarfism, creating an odd, inauthentic experience. The film struggles to balance its message with entertainment, ultimately leaving audiences feeling disconnected. The modern twists don't feel earned and overshadow the timeless appeal of the original.",1/10

"This movie was a huge disappointment. The storyline felt rushed and lacked the charm of the original. The characters were underdeveloped, and the performances didn't capture the magic that made the classic so beloved. The visuals were nice, but they couldn't make up for the weak script and lackluster direction. Overall, it felt like a missed opportunity to breathe new life into a timeless tale.

Also really fell flat for me. It seemed like they tried too hard to modernize the story but ended up losing the essence of what made the original so special. The pacing was off, and some of the new characters felt unnecessary. The music was forgettable, and I found myself tuning out during crucial scenes.

The ""movie"" is a mess, you can see where they hard to redo scenes, it's chopped up. The cgi is as generic as every other film out now, the singing is ok but that's to be expected with the technology they have now to enhance vocals etc. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet but my advice would be to avoid it. My daughter didn't like it and she's always loved princess shows/movies/theatre. This movie is just more proof that there is no quality control in Hollyweird anymore, its about quantity. Save your money and wait until it's on streaming, at least then you can turn it off without wasting your money. Bad acting, bad cgi, bad production, just all bad.",1/10
"When I saw the classic Snow White and her beautiful story, I was enchanted. The character was a soft spoken princess and she was not a girl boss, she was not singing like she was in a production in a theatre belching out notes that belong elsewhere. The prince and Snow White was a true love's kiss, unlike the frozen side lip kiss of this movie. I am sorry, I wanted to love the movie, it was impossible. The plot was ridiculous, it made no sense. The acting was horrifying and the CGI was disturbing. Nothing seemed natural, it was filmed in a box and the whole scheme of colors was odd. I do not recommend the movie, for young children, teenagers or adults. Instead, watch the version of Walt Disney.",1/10
"It was created with care and love for the original. Rachel Ziegler sang with nuance and passion. She is remarkably talented. I hope to see her in many more movies. Gal Gadot was effective in her role, amusingly outraged. The sets were surreal and lovely, like the original. The themes were finding courage when you feel insignificant, the importance of unity, and that beauty is deeper than appearance. The CGI dwarves were done as well as CGI gets, but real actors would have improved the film dramatically. I would have liked to see the leader of the bandits have more character dimension, and the bandits to resemble...bandits. They seemed more like the cast of The View, and had not enough development to justify including them in the narrative. But as a musical with vivid colors, passionate performances, and positive themes, your children will enjoy it.",7/10
"What an absolute disaster. The story lacked depth, the characters were bland, and the overall execution felt uninspired.

"This just seems way off. Gal Gadot just showing up for the check. I have nothing against live actions of the classics, I'm genuinely excited about LILO and Stitch. Stitch looks perfect and they seem to be following the story. In this movie they just do whatever , showing a lack of respect to the original and it doesn't work.

The cgi is poor, some characters making you feel uncomfortable.

Snow White can sing, but her performance itself seems blunted. The casting of this film doomed it, the mismatching is too hard to look past and that coupled with poor performances, poor CGI, poor story telling, just make this film what it is.",1/10
"I had low expectations for Snow White 2025, but somehow it still managed to underwhelm. The film takes a beloved story and drowns it in heavy-handed messaging, clunky dialogue, and a plot that feels like it was stitched together by a committee with no clear vision. The CGI is shockingly subpar-think early 2000s video game cutscenes-and the dwarfs (or whatever they're calling them now) are reduced to forgettable caricatures that add nothing to the story.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White tries hard, but the script gives her little to work with; she oscillates between wooden and overly dramatic without finding a believable middle ground. The songs, which should've been a highlight, are forgettable at best and cringe-inducing at worst- autotune can't save lyrics that sound like they were written by an AI with no soul. The pacing drags, stretching a simple fairy tale into a bloated 2-hour slog that left me checking my watch.

This isn't a fresh take; it's a soulless cash grab that disrespects the original while failing to stand on its own. Save your money and rewatch the 1937 classic instead.",1/10
"As someone who grew up loving Snow White, I was genuinely looking forward to this new version. But right from the beginning, it was hard to stay engaged - mainly because the casting of Snow White just doesn't work.

The role of Snow White has always carried a certain image: soft-spoken, kind-hearted, and with a kind of timeless beauty that fits the fairy-tale world. Unfortunately, the actress in this adaptation doesn't quite capture any of that. Her presence on screen feels out of sync with the character's essence - both in how she looks and how she carries the role. There's a noticeable lack of warmth and that dreamy, classic charm you'd expect.

Reinterpreting a story is one thing, but when the lead feels miscast, it makes it difficult to connect with the film at all. It's not about expecting a carbon copy of the original - it's about understanding what made the character special in the first place. In this case, that part seems to have been overlooked, and it leaves the film feeling hollow, no matter how pretty or modern it tries to be.",1/10
"This movie made more harm then good.

Disappointing and Uninspired - A Letdown for Fans

I had high hopes for the new Snow White, but unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the most disappointing adaptations I've seen. The film completely lacks the magic and charm of the original, replacing it with a dull, uninspired story that feels forced rather than heartfelt. The lead performance is underwhelming, and the changes to the classic characters and themes feel unnecessary and, frankly, disrespectful to the beloved source material.

Visually, the movie is unimpressive. The CGI is mediocre, and the cinematography lacks creativity, making the entire experience feel lifeless. The dialogue is bland, and the script tries too hard to push modern messages at the expense of genuine storytelling. Instead of creating a fresh and engaging.",1/10
"I feel like the fundamental idea of a live action Snow White wasn't bad, and that they had a lot of potential making this movie, but sadly it went straight in the trash.

First off, is it that hard to hire actual dwarf actors instead of using cheap and poor CGI?

And couldn't they have used some of their ""massive budget"" on actually good costumes and dresses instead of this cheap TEMU outfits?

And who let Gal Gadot get a role in this? She can't act, and to play a true Disney villain you must have skill, and she clearly dosent.

It's a sad excuse of a movie. I feel sorry for Rachel who is the only person in this movie who seems like she's trying to do something.",1/10
"It was just bad. Very bad. A couple highlights but dozens of letdowns.

Love that they paid homage to many of the 1937 scenes, like the haunted forest scene and the amazing ""Whistle While You Work"" number.

But the other scenes, including the TERRIBLE CGI of the dwarves coupled with Gal Gadot's stiff and cringey performance, were an apple for disaster.

Definitely think there is a lot of merit in the lessons to be taught in the storyline, but it does linger quite a lot in the middle of the film, though it starts and ends with a few good scenes.

I can only give this film 2 stars, one for Rachel Zegler's phenomenal voice/acting and the other for the costuming.

Definitely the worst of all live-action remakes, executed poorly, and what sucks is it had so much potential, but in the end, the poison apple appeared more satisfying. Yikes.",2/10
"The movie is totally unwatchable. It could be used as a torture for criminals. People who have stayed till the end in the theater deserve some sympathy.

I actually don't know what Disney was thinking after all those negative feedback after the trailer dropped. They thought people would just forget and forgive but it would have worked if it was a decent movie but it is not. Absolutely not. Please remove this from the theaters and give people their money back.

In future Disney should consider casting actors who would represent the character they play not what they made here. Please when making films remember the audience.",1/10
"This is a fun movie, and Rachel Zegler does a great job as Snow White. I liked it better than the original animated version and better than all the other Disney live action remakes. The only comparison I make with any remake (think Aladdin or the more recent Twisters) is was it entertaining and stand on its own? Snow White does that. Gal Gadot, who was so appealing in Wonder Woman, seemed a little subdued - not bad, just seemed more cold and aloof than evil and scheming. The story moves along at a great pace, and wow! Can Rachel Zegler sing. I can't believe she's not in her mid-thirties because her voice is full and nails every note. Finally, I didn't love the hair and wish Disney had let her wear in longer or just cut and styled it in a bob. Then.",8/10
"First thing I would like to say is Rachel is absolutely incredible in this movie. You can tell she put her whole heart into Snow. From her powerful vocals, to her wonderful character, she's got it all in this movie! Absolutely stunning! I think she shines the most out of all of these actors The second thing I'd like to touch on is how they take the original film from the 30's and they modernize it. Not to a bad degree at all, it works very well! Not only that, but the change in storyline makes a lot of sense and I really enjoyed it! We got to see a new show side to these characters (For example Dopey and Johnathan, who is a bandit that replaced the Prince character in the OG movie) and I think it worked well with what they added. Gal's performance wasn't the best I will say.",-/10

"It does not make sense this should have been a completely new movie has nothing to do with snow white original. Is has some nice touches like the whistle scene but that all about it. Sorry Disney bit you have to try more and please next time stay put to the original story line this is why People like you because they expect original old style fairytales, don't take that way from the. If you can't be true to your past you can and should allow for other studios to be able to use the story's to produce movies close to the original the only thing changed should be new cinematography and some special effects.",1/10
"They had the opportunity to create something truly magical; a visually stunning, heartfelt adaptation that honored the original while bringing new depth to the story. Instead, what we got was a lifeless, uninspired remake that lacks the charm, warmth, and timeless wonder of the classic. Rather than breathing new life into a beloved tale, the film feels like a soulless cash grab, exploiting the nostalgia of multiple generations without respecting the magic that made Snow White so special in the first place. The result is not just a disappointment but a crushing blow to the childhood dreams of those who grew up cherishing the original. Instead of rekindling the joy and wonder that Disney is known for, this remake diminishes it, leaving behind something forgettable and hollow.",1/10
"I approached this ""adaptation"" with a cautious optimism, but it quickly devolved into a baffling cinematic experience. It's a tragedy to witness a beloved animated classic so thoroughly mishandled in the name of ""modernization."" Disney should have simply created an original film. The narrative felt disjointed and misdirected, while the CGI was jarringly poor, creating a disconnect from any sense of immersion. My three-year-old, accustomed to the animated version, was visibly upset by the jarring visual differences. The casting choices were questionable, with a lead actress lacking the necessary charisma to carry such an iconic role. The script meandered, and the acting, in general, was wooden and unconvincing. This film embodies everything that's wrong with contemporary cinema's approach to classic adaptations. It's a complete disaster, and a profound disappointment. Disney desperately needs to reassess its direction and remember its core audience. If parents find it unpalatable, children won't either. Save your time and money; this is a regrettable misstep.",1/10
"This movie is a textbook example of how to alienate the very people who would have supported it. Instead of respecting the timeless charm of Snow White, they decided to reinvent it for an audience that was never interested in the first place. The result? A soulless, confused mess that lacks any of the magic, heart, or storytelling that made the original beloved.

The irony is almost comical-casting a supermodel as the Evil Queen while having Snow White played by someone who, let's just say, doesn't quite fit the role. And let's not forget the male lead, who looks like Lord Farquaad in live-action. It's as if they deliberately wanted to parody themselves.

The visuals? Dull and uninspired. The writing? Preachy and lifeless. The acting? Forced and unnatural. It feels like a corporate checklist of how to ruin a classic while patting themselves on the back for doing so. If this was supposed to be a fresh take, then maybe Snow White should have stayed asleep.",1/10
"Something is bad wrong at Disney. This was an empty production that lingered into oblivion with dull acting, cheap sets, and nothing of redemptive value.

Racheal Zegler is nothing comparable to the character of Snow White... lacking the softness and genuine beauty of the character, she was lacking in just about everything that would make Snow White a star in this movie. It is very sad that Disney has failed in this production in such a way that you feel you have wasted time and money to see this film.

The producers and directors involved with this production have lost all sense of what the original Snow White was created and brought to kids and families to enjoy. They too lack talent and should not have been paid to make this awful remake.

The final destination for this movie is the storage warehouse to collect dust... Disney should refund all movie-goers.",1/10
"Aside from Rachel's voice .... the whole thing is long and boring . Gal is gorgeous , but she isn't the best vocalist and omg there is so so so much CGI. Also ... just a thought : Disney why cast someone who hates their own character ? And why would you take dwarf acting completely away from ... oh I don't know dwarves ? In the end , won't see again, was sad that everything that was spoken about , was actually true, and don't think this one will be remembered as one of the good live actions . This one will go down with the lion king...unrememorable , boring , and not enjoyable in my opinion ...",1/10
"Seriously? All they have to do is remake the original. A close remake and they would have made SOOO much money. That's why it's weird when you think about it. Maybe it's not about bringing these classics back. It's about the message, it's about pushing something. They literally wasted 300 million dollars pushing a their agenda. It's literally not hard to do a live action version of Snow White. It's already loved for what it is. So REMAKE IT! Shot by shot. But nope... they couldn't do that because they're trying to sell us something that's not entertainment. It's their personal message. This could have easily been a slam dunk but someone thought they knew better. Who was it. Idk but I'd be looking at the writers and the ones who hired the writers.",1/10
"Disney once again destroyed a timeless classic film and story. The acting was horrible and the storyline wasn't well thought out. The actress didn't capture the essence and personality of Snow White in any way shape or form. The storyline was disjointed and didn't contain any substance or have the flow that Disney movies from the past captured. It's remarkable to me that so many highly paid screen writers, producers, actors, executives and the hundreds of other personnel that worked on this Disney film didn't throw a flag on the play. Disney is unfortunately continuing their self destructive behavior. It could have been so much better but apparently they do not care.",1/10
"First lets get alll those negative reviews out of the way. If you were going to hate it why did you even go to see it? Had it been left without any changes, it would have been wrong because, let's face it... Women should not be wimps, and that's why the character of the evil queen is so much fun in here. She's greedy, powerful and ambitious. She goes after the kingdom, the jewels, and Snow White

In the original she is a one dimensional.character who yearns for beauty. She's boring. What helps her even more is that she gives Snow White the opportunity to talk back and in the final scenes she faces a worthy enemy.

The production values are excellent and the dwarves, unlike what most people argue aren't bad they're not cute, but they have personalities. Theor roles are expanded a little bit.

Ziegler can sing and act. She's not a damsel in distress. This time she's a fighter and a leader, and there's nothing wrong with her.

So, what if the songs are not instant classics. They're ok. Go and enjoy a perfectly fine adaptation that lives up to the lens of modern days.",9/10

The acting is cringey ESPECIALLY from Rachel Zegler, it's boring as hell, everything that made the original charming has been stripped away, and I'm sorry, who in the hell could seriously believe that Rachel Zegler (Lord Farquaad) is the 'fairest one of all' OVER GAL GADOT?

"This is one of the worst live action adaptations in history. Its script butchers the original story with unnecessary changes and a clumsily forced message. The film is utterly ridiculous, with scenes that feel like unintentional parodies and embarrassingly bad CGI. The direction is incompetent, resulting in lifeless performances and soulless moments. The only redeeming factor is Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, her magnetic presence and elegant performance elevate a film that, without her, would be a complete cinematic insult. Undoubtedly, a disgraceful failure.

Disney should stop doing these things and stop radically changing the characters from animated works.",2/10

Please be original, we as a Disney fans since a kid we really did hoping you guys to make a better movie, better storyline, better character and better actress/actor to fix what you've done to this ""Snow White"" thingy.

You guys always make me us disappointed with your live action movies.

"I took my daughter to see the new Snow White movie, and we both left completely heartbroken. This film is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The plot is incoherent, the characters feel soulless, and worst of all, there are no dwarves - something my daughter was really looking forward to. She kept asking, ""Where are the dwarves?"" and ended up crying before the movie even ended. It was supposed to be a magical experience, but instead it felt like a hollow, joyless mess. Whatever magic the original had is completely gone. Disney has truly lost its way. Dont waste your time or money as I did.",1/10
"I thought people were exaggerating when they said the movie was bad, but watching it myself, I realized they were actually holding back. It was much worse than I expected. Everything was wrong, from the characters and the way they talked, to the really bad acting.

Even the special effects, which should have been good since they spent a lot of money, were surprisingly awful. I couldn't believe how bad they looked.

The characters were boring, and the actors seemed like they didn't care. Everyone's performance fell flat. It felt like the movie was just made to make money, without any real effort put into it.",1/10
This is the first worst Disney movie I saw. I was with my kids they watched the orinigal snow white so in such a young age they were expecting it to be the same plot. But in the end it did not. Such a disappointment. Also please get a princess that has a real life Disney attitude. I have to say Disney went down the hill with this movie. I don't recommend this if you still like to keep the image of Snow White refrain from watching as it will totally disappoint with the original plot. Effects were cheaper compared to Little Mermaid the main character is not fit for this. Save your money don't do it.,1/10
"""Snow White"" (2025) attempts to modernize the classic fairy tale but ultimately falls short. The plot is disjointed and filled with inconsistencies, making it confusing. Characters lack depth, with Snow White feeling more like a stereotype than a fully realized individual. The performances are flat and unconvincing, resulting in a lack of emotional connection. Visually, the film is uninspired, which diminishes the overall experience. Additionally, the pacing is erratic, with some scenes dragging on while others rush crucial moments. Overall, this adaptation misses the mark and leaves viewers disappointed. A more thoughtful approach could have made it worthwhile.",1/10
"Went into this expecting to hate it, but surprisingly I didn't, because it was an enjoyable film. Stays true to the original but adds new elements to it. Gal Gadot and Rachel Ziegler may have had bad tension off camera, but it didn't come through on camera.

Now I'm not saying this movie is great, the problems are with musical numbers, they just don't become something you want to sing too. Rachel Ziegler and Andrew Burnap don't have any chemistry, I think she more chemistry with Gadot and the seven Dwarfs. The effects of the dwarfs are well done. And Ziegler and Gadot play their roles very well and never seem like there sleepwalking through it.",8/10
"By Ian Chandler - March 25, 2025

The 2025 remake of Disney's Snow White is unnecessary, but does it have to be rated as low as Manos: The Hands of Fate? The film stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the evil queen. First of all, I'll say that Zelger has an admittedly good voice, which is necessary for the musical numbers. However, the overall performances from the two leads are not outstanding. I don't know if it's because of the script, direction, or them eyeing a paycheck; whatever it is, the acting isn't exactly noteworthy. Despite the rough first impressions, this remake isn't nearly as soulless as the Lion King one from a few years ago. And, while I am at it, there is some, but not a sufficient amount of imagination in this project.

The film is a colorful adventure through and through. Some of the backgrounds pop with vibrancy and some of the CGI elements, mostly the animals, are adorable and expressive. However, the reliance on CGI is a bit on the heavy side, as it was also applied to the seven dwarves. Yes, you heard that right, the dwarves are CGI animations in this live-action remake. Have they forgotten about prosthetic makeup? They could have even pulled a trick from the Hobbit trilogy, where a taller character is on a green screen, enabling them to be digitally larger than the others. To give credit, though, these dwarves are expressive and are fun to be around.

The musical numbers are also a little forgettable, as the only one I could faintly remember is a song about whistling. The plot has similar beats to the original, but it seems to have taken some deviancies. Though I can see that angering some people, I am one of those people who likes to see some new ideas thrown in. Otherwise, you have virtually no reason to watch these remakes, as they are usually inferior to their source material. The pacing is also a little strange, as it is sometimes speedy, and other times it is as quick as a turtle. Neither are wrong by themselves, but the pacing must be consistent. The ending is a bit abrupt too.

The camerawork is nice, though. Some shots look rather good, but again, the overuse of CGI does hamper some to varying degrees. The goofy sequences with the dwarves are complimented by the zany cinematography. And just as mentioned before, the dwarves are easily the most enjoyable part of this movie. You might ponder whether or not it would have been a better idea to make a spinoff about their lifetimes instead. Even so, there is no reason for this film to be rated as low as 1.6! This movie? Sure, it is far from great, and it is a blatant cash grab; but there is some entertainment to be found here, at least. Also, it's far better than that Lion King remake. Though, I must mention, I haven't seen the original Snow White movie in full, despite how revolutionary and acclaimed it was. Perhaps that will invalidate some of my points here.

Score: 60/100

Summary: This remake has a handful of good ideas, colorful cinematography, and some fun characters to grin at, but almost every element is lacking in some way.",6/10
"Absolutely dreadful. Snow White is a tired, predictable snooze-fest that somehow manages to make a poisoned apple the most interesting character. The dwarves are an annoying gimmick-seven times the irritation for no payoff-and Snow White herself is a bland, helpless caricature who stumbles through the story with all the charisma of a soggy breadcrumb. The prince? A walking plot device with zero personality. The animation might've been groundbreaking once, but it's now just a creaky relic propped up by nostalgia. Even the songs feel like they're trying to bore you to death. One star, and that's generous-skip this outdated mess unless you're desperate for a nap.",1/10
"We went with my daughter, she didn't like the dwarfs, Gal acting is atrocious, I don't think we will see another Disney movie again.

And the singing holy moly, every sentence is a song, The CGI dwarves are insane, there is no roles for dwarves and small people, and you replace them with a green screen.

The remoción of the love story with the prince just changes the hole story.

Snowwhite is suppose to have a different personalitie that Rachel give her.",1/10
"The remake of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" fell flat for several reasons, leaving audiences disappointed. It lacked the charm and magic of the original, leaning heavily on modernized storytelling that felt forced and out of sync with the beloved classic. Key characters were poorly developed, and the dynamic between Snow White and the dwarves, which was central to the original, felt watered down. Additionally, the production decisions, such as uninspired set designs and lackluster special effects, failed to evoke the whimsical fairy-tale ambiance that fans cherish. Many viewers felt the remake prioritized style over substance, leaving behind the heart and soul of the story that made the original an enduring masterpiece. It serves as a reminder that reimagining a classic requires capturing the essence of the original while adding fresh, meaningful layers-not just superficial updates.",1/10
"Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White is nothing short of a disaster. Instead of embodying the warmth, charm, and innocence that made the original character so beloved, she delivers a performance that feels forced, detached, and utterly lifeless. Her line delivery lacks emotion, her expressions are awkward, and at times, it seems like she's just reading from a script rather than bringing a character to life.

There's no sincerity in her performance, and her attempts at conveying strength or independence come off as shallow and uninspired. Even her interactions with other characters feel unnatural, as if she's simply going through the motions without any genuine connection. In a film that desperately needed a strong lead to carry its modernized vision, Zegler's flat, charisma-free acting drags the entire movie down.

Disney could have cast someone who understood the heart of Snow White, but instead, we got a protagonist who seems embarrassed to even be in the role. This remake was already unnecessary, and her performance only solidifies it as one of Disney's biggest misfires.",1/10
"Like re-imagining Homer's Odyssey or Shakespeare's Hamlet, or maybe trying to invent something important like the wheel, the path to failure is easy - not everyone is a Shakespeare or a Homer, and very few people really change the course of history with the inventions of their mind.

This new Snow White lacks much-no soul, no vision, just the hollow echoes of zeitgeist-driven whims. But to be fair, rewriting and retelling old fairy tales is nothing new. The original stories are often far too dark and cruel for children, at least for the modern era. Many of the tales we know today are softened versions of the originals collected and recorded by the Brothers Grimm. In that sense, most of Disney's and Hollywood's adaptations have never been entirely faithful to their source material.

That said, this latest disneyfied version is particularly cringe-worthy in its forced ""zeitgeist improvements"" and, in my opinion (I like to repeat myself here), lacks any real soul - just like so many productions these days. In short: bad to mediocre storytelling and character-development, too much agenda (at least for my taste).

The pro? The production quality is solid, but the best part? Gal Gadot as the Queen. The magic mirror must be blind. ;)",3/10
"This is one of my all time favorite stories and movies from my childhood. I waited YEARS to watch this only to be completely irritated the entire time with this monotone, boring, talentless hack, Gal Gadot. Stop promoting this terrible actor. JFC.

Rachel Zegler on the other hand is incredible. She makes the audience feel completely immersed with her ability to play the character authentically, her ability to actual read her lines in a way that suspends disbelief (unlike Gal Gadot) and she's a PHENOMENAL singer. I would watch this movie 1000 more times if the Evil Queen was played by literally anybody else. You could pick a shoe off of the ground and put make up on it and it would be a better performer than this hack Gal Gadot.",2/10
"That was almost 2 hours of my life wasted by Disney yet again.

What has happened to this once grand producer of wonderful cinema?

The agenda, the message, the disregard for history, character development, narrative.

All we get these days is glossy vapid preachy nonsense, again the CGI is a disaster, they should have made the little people the evil characters in the movie because they caused far more fear and dread in us than the so-called evil queen did. I'm predicting the kids will have nightmares from those 7 abhorations Disney threw at us.

For us older viewers, it's impossible to watch the film and see Zegler on the screen without immediately thinking about her toxic entitled rhetoric in all interviews given to promote the film and it immediately takes you out of the picture until those terrifying little people return to zap you away from your thoughts and back into terror.

Gadot should have been wonderful as the evil queen but somehow she just wasn't.

I was expecting a 5 star film and experience, I left with a 1 star which managed to drag itself into a 2 star experience with some pretty cinematography.

"By the way, folks, there's a 1937 animated movie Snow White and the Seven Samurai-oops, I mean Dwarfs. Not the best, but a good cartoon. So, don't confuse it with that movie-they're quite different. The cartoon is about a girl hiding from her evil stepmother who wants her dead, while the movie is about a completely different girl and some kind of struggle against an evil sorceress who, by the way, doesn't even know how to throw fireballs.

But seriously, modern Disney has completely butchered the original, distorting the story and characters beyond recognition, releasing a pathetic knockoff. But let's be honest-was anyone really surprised?",9/10
"Unfortunately we reached a point where the expectations are set so low that even if the project itself is actually pretty decent (such as this picture) people are going to hate it no matter what.

Probably the biggest problem going into the movie is how inconsistent of a filmmaker Marc Webb is and obviously the elephant(s) I the room: Zegler and Gadot.

Zegler has some serious facial acting problems ant times and Gadot is well known as a mediocre actress at best, but Webb was actually able to somewhat hide those issues expertly.

Another really huge problem with Zegler was the fact that she's consider (by most) a worse looking woman than Gadot, but the casting choice was excellent with the direction that the screenplay took and didn't the fact that she's a black actress didn't feel forced at all.

I'm not here to call this a masterpiece, but I'm definitely defending a picture with great technical use of the camera and cgi, surprisingly good enough acting and a screenplay that made me feel like a kid, smiling and being emotional with the story as it progressed and that's what really matters in my opinion when watching these types of movies.",6/10

Instead, we get a preachy, soulless disaster that completely disrespects the original. The CGI is awful, the acting is wooden, and the dialogue is pure cringe.

Live action remakes are generally never my thing to begin with. Let's give it a chance said some friends and as a group already going into it with the absolute lowest of expectations. This one digs deeper and somehow was even worse than we thought. Costumes are tacky and cheap looking. I feel like I've seen better costumes at a grade school Halloween party. Dwarves were cringy and corny I couldn't find any allure in any of their characters. The animation for this day and age didn't do much either. Mediocre at best. People make this out to be Rachel's doing and it has little to nothing to do with it. Gal's acting was so stoic it genuinely reminded me of Steven Segal. It was half baked and completely uninspiring. Virtually every person that suffered through this movie with me all found that Gadot has got to go. Better find a different career choice if this is supposed to be her 2025 star movie. Maybe another frivolous Fast Movie is more suited for that kind of performance. Absolutely terrible.,1/10
"Why did they have to rewrite the story so much? Why not create a new story? If you had to change every element of the story, might as well create a brand new story. The movie lost its charm in the very first quarter hour and kept getting worse later

Rachel Zegler carry the whole movie but I think Selena Gomez fit for the role of Snow White, I didn't say Rachel acting is awful but Selena can sing and act. Songs are great and catchy and Jonathan and Snow White chemistry is mid. I think Disney is the one who ahould be blame for this. But, this movie still worth time, give it a try or you should wait in disney plus to stream.",7/10
"What an abomination.

Why do they think they can and should get away with this nonsense.

Please go back to creating decent television and movies rather than just attempting to wind the general public up.

The whole story has been ruined by poor casting and production mistakes.

If Disney continues to produce drivel like this then this once great company will be finished.

I for one would just show my children the original version if I could ensure first that no royalties would be paid to this ineptly managed company.

I just hope that the Disney executives will learn from this debacle.

Bye bye Disney.",1/10
"The acting was appalling. Gal Gadot shouldn't have a career after this. I left the theatre feeling as though I had not just wasted my time and money but my brain cells also. I genuinely believe that I would have done a better job than Gal in this role. Disney has really fallen off in recent years.

I cannot think of a worse way to spend your time. I wouldn't even put this movie on for background noise. Everything about it was abysmal, from the acting, to the CGI and even the storyline. Why reinvent the wheel? The original Snow White was miles better.

If you read this, please do yourself a huge favour and never watch this movie.",1/10
"This could've been redemption for Disney, but they chose to cater to the maybe 2% of population who might find this entertaining, except they probably don't even watch Disney movies.

From the concept, CGI, songs, costumes, everything is awful.

Honestly, if your stars and producers hate the original story so much, why not create a new story altogether instead of reframing a beloved ""dated"" story... weird, weird.

At the very least, they could've tried to make the story compelling, but they couldn't even do that, instead they trusted the message they wanted to put across was enough and obviously it just wasn't. Shame.",1/10
Never been a huge fan of live action remakes. This one just proved my thought again. Also the CGI in this mlone looked the worst I've seen gone back to the late 90s. Unless we were going for them to look fake next to snow white. I wish disney would figure how to come up with a new story rather than recycling old ideas trying for a cash grab.if I could go back and not pay for this movie that would be great. I wanted my money back about 20 mins in. With rising costs of tickets and food at the theatre it's no wonder that no one wants to go any.ore. Long story short poor CGI and no more live action remakes please.,1/10
"I really wanted to like this. I really did. I was familiar with all the negative comments prior to its opening, but I have seen many fine films attacked unfairly for a variety of reasons that I've ended up loving. I do not allow critic reviews or peoples opinions to determine my love of a film I wanted SNOW WHITE to be one that was maligned by others but loved by me. Sadly, it wasn't. Even at an hour and 49 minutes the movie drags terribly. I was bored too much of the time. There are subplots to the original story that come out of nowhere that make little sense to why they are there other than to give the old story a little kick. The message that is sent at the end is a good one, but it's conveyed too late in the story and not strong enough. The mixture of live action and CGI occasionally blend nicely, but all too often reminds one of the process and takes the viewer out of the story. I kept thinking ""why didn't they just stick to the original and make the entire movie CGI""? That would've been more visually exciting than the weird combination of dark effects you get here. Poor Rachel Zegler has a nice persona, but doesn't possess the necessary ""magic"" needed for the character. She's stuck in a dull fantasy where too much responsibility is placed upon her to hold together. She's frankly a little too mature for the part of Snow White and while Gal Gadot works valiantly to muster evil in every expression, the woman is too nice and friendly looking to ever be perceived as frightening or evil. She and Zegler could easily switch roles. The one nice piece of casting is Andrew Burnap who is at home in these type of surroundings and is refreshing as the counter part to the Prince. The CGI Dwarfs, rather than endearing, often made me cringe in embarrassment. I might have warmed up to the picture if the score was good. It isn't. The new songs are horribly monotone sounding like they're trying desperately to be like prior Disney musicals. I really hated the score. In short, the movie lacks imagination and is all over the place in search of what it wants to be. A real flatfooted disappointment for this viewer. However, viewers and children who have never seen the original may like it.",3/10
"Even though her voice is great, it's funny that she's Latina-and so is her mother. She doesn't portray any of Snow White's sweetness; she's just angry at the Queen all the time. She can be angry, but there still needs to be some of Snow White's innocence and gentleness. Even when she sings, she doesn't feel like a princess at all. I felt like she was playing Lucy Gray again.

As for the Queen, she's just beautiful-there's no real menace in her performance. The dwarfs are cute, though. The storyline mostly follows the original, just without the prince. It's pretty cliché, but still better than The Little Mermaid and Mulan. You can watch it to pass the time.",2/10
"People are acting like rachel decided the custom the production and singing voice. When clearly the blame should be disney and the production who suck!!!!!! They changed the storyline, the decided the dwarf would be cgi. They decided to cast the worst actress gal gadot who is literally playing herself honestly. Yh she said really weird things but the blame is still Disney who are saying to her that the story should be changed and modernised. Disney is to blame for this horrible adaptation. I can't handle how people blame Rachel as if she made Disney and the production. She is a young girl, who is at the start of her career she is an amazing singer and actress.",1/10
"One star is far too generous.

One of the old school Disney classics. Simple story to follow but they had to add an unnecessary twist. The acting is horrendous from the main character especially but also everyone else. The worst had to be the CGI characters, stuff of nightmare. I thought the live action Little Mermaid was horrendous but this takes the throne. Disney has been on a descent for some time now and I see they are not slowing down.

A shame for all the good set designers, costume designers, camera people involved in this atrocity, I hope they at least got a fair pay.

I can't recommend this to anyone!",1/10

"After reading some negative reviews, I was worried that my anticipation for this movie was all for naught. Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs has always been a favorite story of mine.

The movie is not perfect, but what is? You can't please everyone, which is why there are so many movies to choose from at the theaters. My motto for movies is just enjoy it for what it is. Don't compare it to anything else.

My most favorite thing: Gal Gadot. She played the role perfectly and did a great job with her songs. I cannot think of a better actress to portray Queen Grimhilde. Loved her crown. Loved her jewels. Loved the clinking. Loved her dresses. Loved the makeup. Loved the transformation scene.

My meh thing: The scenery was a bit too artificial. It could've been presented better. The live-action scenes seemed like a Broadway play with canvas backdrops. However, the animals were adorable, especially the deer. The first time we see the dwarfs in the mine is a lot of fun to watch.

My least favorite thing: Snow White's hair. I mean, it could've used a bit of flair.",7/10
"I guess if unintentional comedy is your thing, you might as well go see this steaming pile of trash. Ridiculous actress who ruins the character of Snow White, on and off the screen? Check. Terrible CGI that would make people in the early 90s cringe? Check. A ""reimagining"" of a classic so embarrassing that not even wall to wall astroturfing could save it? Check.

But seriously folks, don't waste your time or money. Even if you're curious about this movie, don't bother. If you wait a month the DVD will be in the $5 bin at Walmart and you can satisfy the urge to stare at the train wreck for a fraction of the cost.",1/10
"I didn't know it was possible to take a beloved fairytale and strip it of all its magic, but Disney's live-action Snow White manages to do just that-and then some. This film is a hollow, lifeless shell of the original, bloated with awkward dialogue, cringeworthy attempts at modern messaging, and some of the worst CGI I've seen in years. Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is painfully flat, lacking any real emotion or charm, while Gal Gadot's Evil Queen comes off like a bored fashion model trying to act menacing but never quite getting there. The sets look fake, the colors are garish, and the entire film feels like it was created by a marketing algorithm rather than storytellers with any passion. It's not whimsical or empowering-it's just dull, soulless, and nearly impossible to sit through without checking the time every five minutes. This isn't a remake; it's a warning.",1/10
"Normally, I don't write reviews-positive or negative-but in this case, I felt compelled to speak up. What an absolute trainwreck of an adaptation. The movie takes everything that made the original material compelling and discards it in favor of baffling choices that add nothing of value. The plot is all over the place, the pacing is inconsistent, and the changes made to key characters and story arcs are not only unnecessary, but downright illogical and confusing. It's as if the creators never understood what made the source material work in the first place.

Honestly, it felt like a disrespectful attempt to cash in on fans' loyalty while delivering a product that has no heart, no soul, and certainly no coherence. The emotional beats fall flat, the dialogue feels forced, and the entire experience left me more frustrated than entertained.

Please, do yourself a favor-if watching this film will cost you money, spend it elsewhere. Go out for a meal with your loved ones, try a new activity, or just stay home and rewatch the original. I genuinely regret spending my money on this, and I won't get that time or cash back. It's not just disappointing-it's infuriating. Save yourself from the same mistake.",1/10

"Zegler could have been cute, but their lens and lighting made her look terrible sometime. The queen reminded me of my mother when she didn't get the cookies on sale, not an evil conspirator. Tragedy.

They made a nonsensical remake of it and pretended it was 100% historically accurate. Oh... this just happened on the same day in another place... I mean, the song is nice, but it's so out of place and inexplicable, even for a movie based on an animation. Yes, I'm not against singing and dancing in movies, Bollywood does it very well sometimes. But let's be honest, in this particular case, it was really screwed up.",1/10
"Snow White is an absolute train wreck from start to finish. The plot, if you can even call it that, revolves around a group of scientists trying to stop a vaguely explained catastrophe, but the incoherent script makes it impossible to care. The acting is wooden, with characters delivering dialogue like they're reading off cue cards. The special effects look like they were made on a decade-old laptop, and the pacing drags endlessly. Worst of all, the film takes itself way too seriously, making it more laughable than thrilling. Avoid this disaster at all costs. The editing is choppy, with scenes awkwardly stitched together, making it feel like a bad student film. The soundtrack is forgettable, with dramatic music playing at the wrong moments. The villains are one-dimensional, their motivations unclear and nonsensical. Even the action sequences, which should be exciting, are poorly choreographed and filled with cheap CGI. The dialogue is cringeworthy, with lines so bad they could be unintentional comedy. The movie tries to build tension but only succeeds in boring the audience. By the end, you'll regret wasting your time.",1/10

"It's much better than everyone thinks it is. Definitely a nice movie and you should go watch it.

I like modern interpretation and I don't think the authors of the movie owe it to anyone to keep it exactly as it was in 1937.

Times change and the story doesn't need to be set in stone.

So go watch it, the hate is not provoked, the movie is decent and well-made. I suggest to go watch and see for yourself if it deserves all the hate.

Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler done a great job performing. Songs and dances are wonderful, loved them all. I can see how much talent and skill went into this. So don't believe what everyone says, go and watch it.",10/10
"Well I love the movie , especially the songs , they were top notch. But the problem was just the Outfit and make up (hair-do) of Snowwhite, if not that , then I love the movie , it was quite interesting . And I hope maybe a Season 2 would do the Trick , because I would love to see THE EVIL QUEEN return and snow white defeat her PROPERLY................ Because the Evil Queen didn't get the right Punishment she deserved, in my own opinion, And maybe a Season 2 would do the trick, and also Make Everything Right Regarding Snow White Costume and Make Up .......... Am rooting for a Snow White 2 sequel.",7/10
"I love Disney and the live action remakes have been awesome. However - I'm not a fan of the trend where we change the whole premise of the film to try to move away from the original story. The plot was awful, it felt forced and the acting was even worse. I would have liked to see an accurate portrayal of Snow White, since the origin of her is a German tale set in the early 1800s - Disney could have done so much with this in terms of how beautiful the set and story could have been and they just didn't deliver. The dwarves looked like they were created by a studio that has no budget and is selling off brand Disney movies to Dollar Tree. I would be embarrassed to be apart of this film.",1/10
"Can Disney make good movies again? This movie was terrible, actress was bad.

The way they changed the story, the drama in it was obnoxious, not even to watch a Sunday at home. Everything about it felt wrong, i feel it broke my idea of snow white. I will only watch the original version.

This version made no sense, it was embarrassing to watch in the movies. I wanted my money back.

Is it possible to get your money back? I dont wanna support their fiasco. No creativity at all.

I dislike when remakes just happen to kill even the original movie or story. I feel like thats what It did to me. Do not watch.",1/10
"The new Snow White movie was a huge disappointment, mainly due to Rachel Zegler's lackluster performance as the iconic character. Her acting felt forced and unconvincing, making it hard to connect with Snow White's journey. Instead of bringing the beloved character to life, Zegler's portrayal fell flat and lacked the charm and warmth we've come to expect. Unfortunately, her performance overshadowed the film's visuals and supporting cast, leaving me unimpressed and wishing for a stronger lead.

Even the visuals and supporting cast couldn't save the film from feeling lifeless. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend taking your kids to see it-it's not worth the time or money when the lead just doesn't deliver.",1/10
"I don't know what I expected, but it sure wasn't this. Disney somehow took a beloved classic and ran it straight into the ground with the grace of a derailed freight train. This Snow White remake is a soulless, cringe-inducing disaster that feels like it was written by people who have never actually enjoyed a Disney movie in their lives.

The lead performance? Flat. The dialogue? Laughable. The CGI? Somehow worse than movies from 20 years ago. The heart and magic that made the original timeless? Completely obliterated. It's like they actively tried to suck all the fun and charm out of it.

I get wanting to modernize a story, but this isn't modern-it's a pretentious mess that treats its own source material like an embarrassment. If you're a fan of the original, avoid this like the plague unless you enjoy being insulted for two painful hours.

Disney, do better. Actually, scratch that-just stop remaking classics if this is the best you can do.",1/10
"At least Snow White was attractive. Other than that the dialog was poor, the actors were poor, the directing was poor, the production was poor, and the writers were beyond poor. It was like going to Bassett VA but instead of white trash it was universal trash.

In the beginning of the movie I was very hopeful. Hopeful that it would be over soon. That's how bad it all started. Literally the first line uttered by the attractive but inept actress that portrayed Snow White sent all sorts of weird feeling down my spine. It takes a lot of weirdness to make me feel weird. I generally have a very high tolerance for that type of thing. After the movie was over, I immediately gargled some mouthwash trying to get the bad taste of this movie out of my mouth.",1/10
"This movie kills everyone childhood its one of the worst remakes for a snow white and even my daughter was really really sad because she was one of her favourite princesses and this movie ruined everything for her (come on Disney why you hate your fans) This film drastically misses the mark in its attempt to reimagine a classic story. The narrative choices made were deeply unsettling and inappropriate for young audiences. My child was visibly distressed by the film's content, which is a significant concern. It strays so far from the source material that it fails to capture any of the charm or magic of the original. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially families with children.",1/10
"What's the point of making a live-action version of a very old animated film if it's going to change absolutely everything that made the original story good? I simply don't understand the decisions that were made. I didn't mind the small change in the cast or the random selection of actors and actresses for the casting. But you can't change the entire story: the beginning, the middle, and the end. You also can't change the personalities of the main characters, much less minimize the evilness of the villain just because she's a woman. The setting looks great; I don't know if it was filmed in a real location or if CGI was used, although the CGI of the Seven Dwarfs is unpleasant to look at, especially through a giant screen in a dark room. I don't recommend watching this film in theaters. If you have the opportunity to stream it, of course, do so if you want, but it's not a good film.",1/10
There are simply stories that aren't meant for every actor.

"Contrary to all opinions here, I really liked the movie.. I expected the worst and in the end I was pleasantly surprised, Gal Gadot stepped into the role and gave the goods, her song was catchy and I found myself humming the song after the movie. Rachel sang amazingly and in the end it was a children's fairy tale that was suitable for children of this age. Compared to the live-action version of The Little Mermaid that Disney made, it was very similar to the original.

In my opinion, they know what they're doing and ultimately the kids are the ones who should love it, and my guess is that they'll love the Evil Queen more than Snow White.

For me it's a 9/10.",9/10
"I had fun like almost all Disney movies maybe because it didn't last that long.

I didn't like Rachel so much but there could have been worse. Gal Gadot slightly better but not that much.

It's visually all very fake and after a while it starts to bother, especially the dwarfs.

I appreciated the songs (not in English).

I had few expectations but it surprised me even if I admit that honestly one of the ugliest live actions ever made by Disney and those of the princesses start and end in the same way.

If you have children take them to the cinema to see it at most you will have a sleep.

Anyway, I will never look at it again.

It's a children's movie, calm down!",6/10
"(No spoilers) I was hoping the movie was not going to be as bad as everyone was anticipating. I can safely say it was not as bad . . . . It was worse unfortunately. Why would you so drastically change the underlying message and feel of such a timeless classic.

To be fair Rachel actually has a great voice and can carry a tune but that about the only positive I can muster regarding this movie. Gal Gadot had an underwhelming performance and the Dwarves were actually scary looking and not lovable in any way shape or form.

It was easy to tell the story was disjointed due to a number or rewrites and adjustments to try to appease audiences but it still feel very short of pleasing.",1/10
"Disney... when will you start doing this the way you used to?

Snow White is a disappointing and joyless reimagining that strips away the charm and wonder of the original.

Instead of honoring the classic, it tries too hard to be modern and edgy, losing all the warmth and whimsy that made the original beloved. The visuals are dull, the songs are forgettable, and even the performances lack spark. It's a soulless, preachy mess that forgets to actually tell a good story. A classic turned into a cringe-worthy misfire.",1/10
"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is so astoundingly awful, so fundamentally broken, that you wonder how anyone involved thought it was a good idea. Snow White (2024) isn't just bad-it's an unwatchable, soulless, insult to cinema. This isn't a movie; it's a dumpster fire set ablaze by Disney's own arrogance and creative bankruptcy.

A Character Assassination of Snow White The original Snow White was a timeless classic with a kind-hearted heroine. This version? A smug, bitter, self-righteous shell of a character who lacks any warmth or charm. Rachel Zegler's performance is as grating as her off-screen comments about how much she despises the original film. Instead of a fairy tale princess, we get a condescending know-it-all who sneers at the very idea of romance, heroism, or anything remotely resembling a compelling story arc.

The ""Dwarfs"" - Or Whatever They Are In what can only be described as one of the worst creative decisions in cinematic history, Disney removed the iconic Seven Dwarfs and replaced them with... a random group of people with no personality, no chemistry, and no reason to exist. They're so forgettable that calling them ""characters"" feels generous. It's like they grabbed a bunch of extras from a failed Netflix show and told them to stand around in the background.

A CGI Catastrophe Visually, Snow White (2024) is an absolute eyesore. The special effects look unfinished, the cinematography is flat and lifeless, and the color grading makes everything look like it was filmed through a dirty window. The original film from 1937-hand-drawn frame by frame-has more life, beauty, and artistry than this entire multimillion-dollar disaster.

Disney's Most Boring Movie Ever If this film had any redeeming qualities-funny moments, an emotional core, or even decent action-it might at least be watchable. But there's nothing. The script is atrocious, the pacing is a disaster, and the entire movie is so lifeless that it feels like a punishment to sit through. Every scene drags on with awkward dialogue and dull performances, making Snow White feel like a two-hour endurance test.

Final Verdict: A Career-Ending Disaster Snow White (2024) isn't just the worst Disney remake-it might be the worst thing the studio has ever produced. It's an insult to the original, a disaster of storytelling, and proof that modern Disney has lost every shred of creativity. Avoid this mess at all costs.

"Disney needs to come up with something new. This is yet another failed live action remake, nothing could save it. The main actress is unbearably unlikeable throughout the entire film (and as a person). Im not sure I've ever seen someone casted worse. For anyone that is a fan of the original Disney classic, steer far away. She is NOTHING like a Snow White and the once simple plot has been destroyed for no valuable reason other than time filler, oh well. Gal Gadot's acting is something only a Razzie could recognize. Multiple times my family was left laughing at her attempt at an acting performance.",1/10
"Completely awful to the very core. Gal Gadot is a glaring weak spot-every scene she's in is flat, soulless, and painfully stiff. Her performance lacks any emotional depth or nuance, making it impossible to connect with her character. Frankly, she should've retired from acting years ago. She doesn't understand the essence of being human, so playing one-even a villain-is a total mismatch. It's not just bad casting; it's tone-deaf on Disney's part. How this got greenlit is baffling. The writing is hollow, the direction uninspired, and the overall experience feels like a bloated, cynical cash grab.

"I think if I was a 10 year old girl or under I would have loved this.

I've seen all the other Snow White movies and unfortunately as much as I like Gal Godot she didn't hold a candle to Charlize Theron in her portrayal, maybe she shouldn't have tried a musical. In fact I think this movie was more musical theatre than a big screen film. I felt like they may have spent the majority of the budget to get Gal to do the movie, she didn't have a huge amount of lines and what she did have she over acted in them.

The female lead playing Snow White was a great actress but I also think it was just rubbish directing and and musical theatre

The story was odd, think of Snow White, the seven dwarves and Robin and his merry men. It was hard to watch. Like I said, if I was a 10 year old girl I probably would have loved it. I loved Gals costumes, they spent too much to get her and not enough on the rest of the film. My lowest rating ever for a movie. 1 star.",1/10
"Beautiful Reimagining of a Classic

The Snow White remake brings fresh life to a timeless fairytale with heart, style, and stunning visuals. While honoring the spirit of the 1937 original, this version dares to reimagine the story in a way that feels relevant, empowering, and emotionally engaging for a modern audience.

Visually, the film is a treat. From enchanting forest scenes to the Queen's darkly magical presence, every frame is rich with detail. The updated soundtrack is fantastic.

It feels like a true musical-grand, emotional, and uplifting. I felt like I was watching a Broadway show on screen, and honestly, the kids and I wanted to stand up and applaud at least three times.",9/10
I thought it was ok . The dwarfs were a little bit weird in cgi . In the cartoon version they're more dwarf like . Dopey look pretty good . But I don't remember him talking in the cartoon . He never speaks or sings . But he does cry at the end of the movie. The opening sequence I don't remember Snow White mentioning her parents. And her father being killed by the wicked queen was never mentioned in the cartoon. The the queen played by gal gadot she did a good job playing the queen . But what didn't surprise was that she talks to the magic mirror more times than. In the cartoon she talks to the mirror 2 times. In the original cartoon the queen dies from being killed by a rock during the rainstorm. In this new version their queen breaks the mirror and kills her which is not quite right. And Snow White running the dark forest was not as scary as I remember. And when she meets the forest animals she sings with a smile and a song . But I'm glade they kept heigh ho and added more notes to the song . The old hag the queen disguises herself wasn't that scary. In the original movie the old hag is more terrifying the way Walt Disney pictured . I feel like Disney should've been more respectful to the original classic from 1937 88 years ago. Lilo and stitch which is gonna hit theaters in may is gonna draw fans back to their childhood 23 years ago.,6/10
"There goes 2 hours I'll never get back. I gave the movie a fair chance but this movie is just bad. Even in world where everyone loves Zegler and think that Gaddot is a good actress, this movie is just Bad.

Bad CGI, Bad Story telling, Bad acting and don't get me started on the seven nightmares aka. Dwarfs.

They should have either Batgirled this movie or just put it on Disney+. This is anything but a theaterworthy movie.

When you rewatch the original cartoon you quickly realize that it's actually enough to make a really good movie. Not epic but good.

Just stick to the sourcematerial. It's not that hard.

"I purchased my ticket for Snow White 2 weeks In advance and was very excited to see this film. I unfortunately was disappointed. They did not build up many of the characters or scenes and it was just not satisfying as a big show white original movie fan. It was a very cheesy film. I normally feel like many Disney movies are enjoyable to watch as an adult, but this movie felt like it was good for small children.

Overall, not the best Disney remake, especially if comparing to other Disney remakes such as Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, or Cinderella. I was shocked to learn that the films budget was $209 million dollars.",3/10
"I tried to like this. I really did. Rachel Zegler's acting was good, but I didn't have a connection to her. The movie felt rushed and the relationships weren't sincere. It wasn't believable that Snow White was the ""fairest of them all"" because it didn't show her do anything special! I found myself bored halfway through. The makeup and special effects were lack luster and the costumes looked cheap. The costumes needed to be more elegant. They used the brightest blue and yellow for Snow White's gown, which is fine for a cartoon, but not a life action. I absolutely hated the zigzags on her maid dress. When the queen transformed into the old hag, her makeup looked like it was melting off. When she spoke it looked just weird! They also got rid of Prince Charming. No prince. Just Jonathan.

"Unfortunately all this movie does is remind of how amazing Disney's 1937 classic is. The characters are generally flat. The evil queen's ""evil"" just doesn't come through; I wish I could blame it solely on Disney's storyboarding, but Ms. Gadot's performance does the character no favors. Ms. Zegler took on no small challenge in her role reprising the character representing peak Disney fantasy and magic. I would forgive any inherent misses in her acting prowess (or lack thereof), but it's all but impossible to get past Disney's modernization of her character. Modernization in itself is no problem (see Baz Luhrmann's take on a story 400 years its senior), but Disney failed to adjust Snow White's entire formula, leaving the viewer to cherry pick when, where, and how to suspend disbelief in an otherwise magical character. The most egregious disappointment was the dwarves. Again, Disney has failed to recognize that the rubber-banded rag doll humor of the 1937 dwarves simply cannot be duplicated in CG, especially when the art design can't decide where it belongs in the spectrum of ""real to ""cartoon"". Remakes are inherently at a disadvantage; still, Disney made specific plot and character choices to resonate with some recent quakes in popular culture: that was a mistake. I wouldn't pay to add this rendition to my library.",2/10
"Read all the reviews and have seen the movie. These are my good and bads:

Good: 1 - Zegler. Perfect casting as Snow White. Ignore the haters she has a natural beauty the embodied the character. Has a great singing voice as well.

2 - The music was exceptional. All the songs were great and suited the theme of the movie. Songs us as 'Whistle while you work, Princess Problems and Waiting on a Wish' were great and it felt like you were at a theatre show.

3 - The Dwarves. Great CGI with each character playing out their namesake with heart and gusto.

Bad: Gal Gadot. Although a very beautiful woman she should stick to action roles. Her talents for musicals are non existent. Every scene seemed to be overacting.

Will I see it again? Yes only for the music.",8/10
"I don't know what you trolls were doing when you saw this, but I liked it. Rachel is a true princess in this, the villain is the right amount of evil and the love interest is a breath of fresh air. I, frankly, found it better than the original. It has just enough references for the fans to notice and is not overly saturated in cutesy stuff, unlike the original. Never mind about the dwarves or the drama behind the scenes. Just leave your drama at the door and this movie won't be a bore. Once you have, you'll find that this film fits the bill for a great flick for the family. It's charming. Nuff said.",7/10
"""Snow White and the seven dwarf"" is a master piece not only in Disney history, but also in the cinema industry. This move remake is an insult to the original and the cast is not, at all, up to the task. Watch the original if you want to see a wonderful movie, not this one.

Everything in here is just very wrong: songs, music and sound (and they were dealing with a very easy task there since the original was nominated for Best score at the Oscars in 1937), costume design, set design, cgi, plot, photography, acting.

Zegler face looks always disgusted by something or someone and I just think that is not the look someone that is impersonating Snow White should have on her face all the time or ever, actually. She does't have a once of kindness in her expressions. It's just not the right person to be act as sweet Snow White. Bad bad acting.",1/10
"Talk about your strange (really, really BAD) casting choices and mismatched talent! Rachel Zegler as the ""... fairest of them all"" while Gal Gadot comes in at second place creates a dissonance for the audience while trying to watch the movie. Nothing against Rachel whatsoever, but she should've been the queen because she looks so much older than Gal Gadot (who really shouldn't have even been in this production in the first place).

Gal Gadot has a ton of presence on screen. It's just too much for her to be cast as the second fiddle. If she's in a scene, all eyes are immediately on her, she's got the audience's sympathy and attention, and if she isn't the story, the story seems less significant like background or filler.

The last time I can recall such poorly matched stars in a movie was Titanic. I loved the movie, but a grown woman upending her whole life for a kid that looked like he just dropped out of high school? The idea that Gal Gadot would be jealous of Rachel Zegler's rather unconventional 'beauty' puts a similar strain on the imagination.",1/10
"Did feel the acting and the movie was far to the expectation. With few good moments but lack connection with characters. Gal was not ideal for the role of the evil queen and this felt dull most of the time. Wouldn't recommend to watch in theaters. The spark as a kid to watch this movie make it more like a boring one and you might get a good sleep in the theater

There is some parts that felt too cliche and the movie kind get boring at times where i understand that everyone knows the story of snow white. But they should at least a touch of uniqueness to it. Moreover they kind of copied previous versions of snow white. Like the acting in itself was weak.",1/10
"Loved the original, was hoping Disney would stay true to the original but they did not I gave this one a chance and it was awful it sadly was NOT snow white but something else. Live action should be as close to the original as possible, Rachel has a great voice but not for this role why is she belting when snow white has a softer tone?? This is NOT frozen if they wanted another strong independent woman they should've made a new princess instead of trying to make snow white elsa.. I wish Disney wouldn't change the princesses just make new ones if you wish to be inclusive because changing a classics storyline just wasn't it...",1/10
"I can't possibly fathom how anyone could enjoy this film or give it any kind of positive review. The actors and acting are terrible, the CGI looks like a five year old made it, and the story is just dull. This has to be one of (if not THE) worst films I have ever seen. There are zero redeeming factors that make this film even worth considering watching. Do not waste your time or money! Don't even wait for it to come to streaming. You'd honestly have a better time watching paint dry. Or you could spend some time watching the grass grow in your yard and you would enjoy it more than this movie. Seriously, just don't!",1/10
"If they played this movie on a plane I would still walk out. They should have made Rachel CGI instead. Please rename this to Mud Brown and the Seven Discord Mods. The CGI looks much better when I turn my monitor off. Im honestly rooting for the poison apple. Why is Lord Faarquad playing snow white? This movie should come with a disclaimer: 'no dwarves were harmed but your childhood might be.' I haven't seen something self-implode this hard since that titan submarine. Snow White and the Seven CGI abominations. Making the dwarves look like a PS1 Hagrid was a bold choice. Rachel Zegler looks like a medieval squire boy. The Marvel's lost $237M dollars, Snow White...hold my beer.",1/10
"A hollow uninspired remake.

Yet another live-action adaptation that strips away the magic of the original. The film feels soulless, bogged down by forced modern updates that add nothing meaningful to the story. Rachel Zegler's performance lacks the warmth and charm needed for the iconic role, and even Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, while visually striking, falls flat. The CGI is unremarkable, and the musical numbers are forgettable at best. Instead of a fresh take, we get a bland, watered-down version that fails to justify its existence. Disney needs to stop recycling classics and start telling new stories.",1/10
"I watched this hoping for a fresh but respectful take on a beloved classic. What I got instead was a confusing, soulless shell of what Snow White once represented. The heartwarming story has been replaced with shallow dialogue, miscast actors, and visuals that feel like a rushed video game cutscene. Rachel Zegler's portrayal lacks depth and charm, and the CGI does no favors to the already hollow world they created. This film neither honors the original nor stands on its own. A disappointing, unnecessary remake that feels more like a corporate product than a fairy tale. Skip it and rewatch the animated gem.",1/10
"I was ready to go into this movie and hate it. After the PR fiasco at D23 two years ago, I really didn't think Disney knew what fans wanted. I stand happily corrected however! The performances from the cast were amazing (all except Gal Gadot, but she only has 20-30 minutes of screen time), and the dwarves in particular melt your heart. It also seems that Disney is finally romanticizing ROMANCE. The love story in this was nothing short of beautiful. I would put this up there with the live action Cinderella and will happily watch it again. Is it groundbreaking? No. But does it give you the feeling of Disney magic? Yes, yes it does.",8/10
"So I really don't understand the 1 scores for this movie, is it going to be a Disney classic ?? Probably not, did they miss out a few things from the original??? Yes, but the world we live in now Disney cant be seen to offend people, but as for the movie, it was done well, songs was good and my God that girl can sing!!

Ok so people are complaining about the CGI, ok my personal opinion, they could of gone better, but they choose not to, they decided to keep it more animated to stay to the story, and if they went to realistic dopey wouldn't of been so lovable character, so I was happy the way the CGI came out

So if you are a over thinker of movies and need to find stuff in movies to moan about, then maybe this movie not for you, and if you are that type of person, just stop and enjoy the movie,",6/10
"This movie falls flat on every level. It strays too far from the beloved classic many of us grew up with, losing the charm and heart along the way. While it clearly tries to modernize and outdo the original, it ends up failing across the board. The pacing is dull, the storytelling lacks depth, and the CGI is distractingly bad. A disappointing attempt at a remake that misses the mark entirely. The main actress completely misses the essence of Snow White's character. She brings none of the kindness, warmth, or innocence that made the original so beloved. Instead of capturing Snow White's charm and gentle spirit, her portrayal feels flat, disconnected, and lacking any emotional depth. It's as if she never studied the role or understood what made the character iconic in the first place.",1/10
"Come on enough is enough. How many times are we going to try and rewrite classic stories with a ""modern twist."" Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, wants this.

Leave the old stories the way they were intended to be, and if you have a problem with them, write something new and different! This movie had no redeeming qualities. Queen was dull, Snow White was uninspiring, and the dwarves completely lacked their original charm.

Viewers, keep in mind that this was supposed to be an IMPROVEMENT to the backlash they originally got when they first released the trailer with the weird CGI-shrunken-live-actors.

Originally, they used live actors and used CGI to shrink them instead of, idk, using real dwarf actors and giving them a chance at the kind of national exposure a Disney move tends to provide???? That's why they were so dull and lifeless they were a cheap bandaid fix to a deeper problem.

Contemporary Disney is so out of touch with their once loyal fanbase that at this rate, they'll be a laughingstock of entertainment by the end of the decade.",1/10
"Where do I even start? Gal Gadot is atrocious in this movie. It is painfully obvious she was only there for the money and didn't care about her acting performance. The Dwarfs look like something out of a low budget early 2000's CGI movie. The budget is over 200 million and yet this is the result? The songs are at least decent, but it is not saving it from a 1/10 rating. Did these writers even watch the original movie? Do not waste your money on this garbage. Enough of these live action remakes! Disney needs to suffer financially until they learn what we the consumers want. Watch the original snow white instead.",1/10
"Well. I thought I would give it a go, despite all the bad press surrounding the lead actress. Very disappointing, the twists in the original were uninspiring and forced. Gal Gadot was brilliant, but the story fell flat and the Snow White actress fell short and felt disingenuous failing to sell her role. Wouldn't recommend, would probably get my money back if I could.

It still baffles me why they would take a childhood classic for millions and butcher it and such a way. Why not start a different movie, the bar was high and the results were awful - save for Gal Galdot who was brilliant, far too beautiful to be the evilgreen eyed queen.",1/10
"A passionless and empty excrescence shoved out with the intent of kindling nostalgia farming using writers and an actor who apparently hate the core of what made the original snow white so charming.

The traits of kindness and genuine gratitude through serving others are absent from this film, and it seems the protagonist doesn't have anything more compelling going for them. The controversy around Zegler's disdain for the original film comes through in the slant that the performance can't overshadow with it's middle of the road nature.

The set, visuals, and overall production quality also leave you wanting something that could feel like you were charmed, but I'd rather have the poisoned apple and have gotten some good sleep instead of this droll cinema we were presented with.",1/10

"Snow White has been a favorite of mine since I was little. But the story is a total mess. It's full of songs, and it feels like Snow White's impression is getting worse. Recently, Disney has changed. The protagonist doesn't resemble Snow White, and where's the prince? That's necessary for a Disney princess. The dwarfs are cute and nice. I only liked the 'Heigh-Ho' song and mirror. I waited for this movie for a long, long time, and I wasted my money and time on it. My boyfriend was sleeping, and a lot of people left while the movie was playing. In the movie, jokes were not funny too... Who made this...",1/10

"I think this movie could be better, but I accept live action limits, because I know it never will be like the homonymous (but not too much) animated film that changed the history of cinema. Whitesnow entertained my 2 daughters, and this movie is created for children at first, not for angry virtual people :) It is well recited, cgi is good, and has a good picture. It is a really fearful work but....no surprises. I saw a glimmer of hope for the future, because there is no longer that insistent search for forced balance . Last but not least, I prefer less of songs. I prefer musicals at Broadway (lol)",6/10
"While Disney attempted to bring some life to a famous story that has done very well in the past, they ultimately failed in doing so. From poor CGI and screenplay to a lackluster main actress, who honestly made large waves off-screen for her comments and attitude, the movie was all around very bad. There was a lot of potential in this version of the story if it had been executed correctly. This, however, was executed very poorly. The singing is great, voices are good, but the songs are forgettable and not catchy or memorable. The visuals are CGI was also done poorly, you'd think with such a large budget that the effects would be better. Adaptations of other movies such as Beauty and the Beast are fantastic movies, and that is how an adaptation should be done. This movie is nothing like that, it fails in all categories and is a poor reflection of Disney's movie potential.",1/10
"After watching the film I will be brief. It has no Disney magic, I see a lot of CGI, and story line doesn't give a good vibe. I gave it a chance, watched it, and payed attention to detail, but it's a no for my family and I. Disney should do better, they are one disappointment after another with remakes. They change too much and expect everyone to embrace change. They really hyped this film after controversial interviews, but the damage was done. Perhaps its best that Disney stop making remakes of already existing movies and focus on putting soul in their movies. This was a desperate attempt to change a story line and modernize, that failed miserably.",1/10
"Not only is the movie a complete waste of time, the acting is terrible, the actress Rachel Zegler, is just as horrible on screen as she is off screen, the story was lackluster and took away from who Snow White is, and the story change was completely unnecessary and made the character different in every single way, and the film that much worse. Not to mention the CGI could've been done a lot better, or just not at all. The costume department wasn't good either, and everything ended up looking flat, and dull, especially the dress, which was nothing like what anyone imagined, the same with the horrible styling they did on Rachel's hair. I wish I could rate this 0, because there simply isn't any part of this that anyone would want to pay to see.",1/10
"Snow White is a soulless, over budget reshot mess of an abomination that butchers a timeless classic. Rachel Zegler's wooden Snow White oozes all the charm of a damp rag, while Gal Gadot's Evil Queen screeches through off-key musical numbers that'll make your ears bleed - a shrieking caricature, warbling tunelessly in musical numbers so atrocious they could curdle milk from across the room. Gadot's performance is less 'regal menace' and more ""Karaoke night gone wrong."" The CGI dwarfs look like uncanny valley rejects, and the plot is a bloated, preachy mess that drowns any hint of magic in a swamp of corporate cynicism. A grotesque insult to the original skip this rubbish and save your sanity.",1/10
"This movie was free for me to watch and I feel like me and everyone in the theater should have been paid to sit through that. This movie missed on every level. This was an unfortunate failed attempt at trying to reimagine a story that needed no reimagining... The acting was not bad, however the over reaching feeling that was the storyline was cringey at best. Disney needs to either tell all new stories or remake the old ones as they were meant to be told. Introducing ""new and modern"" ideas into a fairy tale doesn't make for good storytelling. Everyone in the audience was walking out muttering about how terrible it was. Two people walked out mid movie and didn't return to their seats. In all, I highly recommend NOT watching it. Save your time and invest it in a better choice.",1/10

"Sad to see such a beautiful story to be ruined. Sad to see. Sad I can't do a zero stars. I recently watched the new Snow White movie, and it was a complete disaster. The plot was a jumbled mess, lacking the charm of the original tale. The characters felt flat and uninspired; Snow White herself was more of a cardboard cutout than a heroine. The dialogue was cringeworthy, filled with clichés that made me roll my eyes. The special effects were subpar, and the pacing dragged, making it feel longer than it actually was. Overall, it was a disappointing attempt to reimagine a classic, leaving me wishing I had stayed home instead. Save your time and skip this one!",1/10
"This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have seen in the past decade. From start to finish, it feels like a complete disaster. The characters seem entirely out of place and fail to align with the essence of the original story, making it feel disconnected and forced. The performances by the main actors are disappointingly subpar, lacking depth, emotion, and authenticity. Every scene feels poorly executed, and the dialogues do little to salvage the mess. The direction appears uninspired, and the screenplay fails to capture any of the charm or brilliance of the original. If you're going to remake a classic, at the very least, stay true to its essence and ensure it retains the originality that made it special in the first place.",1/10
"It seems that everyone is upset that SnowWhite is not that. Add a bit of color into a character and it drives people crazy. I'm glad they are doing it this way. HOORAY. It's time for change out with the old and in with the new. All characters need a remake for the future. I would not be upset at all if Pocahontas was recreated with lighter skin , so why the opposite. Go see this movie and don't pay no mind to all the sour reviews from certain people. The singing is great and it keeps you entertained throughout the movie. Long live the new SnowWhite. I can't wait to see what's next and who will be recreated.",-/10
"Snow White tries to simultaneously be a complete reinvention of the animated original and a very faithful adaptation where scenes are lifted directly from its predecessor so the results are undoubtedly messy but it avoids being the worst Disney live action remake. It tries to fix most of the problems with its source material in a noble fashion and a lot of the new ideas work well enough, they just almost go unnoticed thanks to the couple of truly baffling ones.

Rachel Zegler is this film's saving grace. Her fantastic singing voice gets plenty of moments to shine and she consistently imbues the film with all the necessary warmth and elegance despite everything working against her, mainly the unflattering haircut she has and some uncanny scene partners. Gal Gadot gives a career worst performance, even if she's clearly relishing the villainy she gets to play it's just so painful to watch, especially when she starts singing.

The no longer titular seven dwarves are relentlessly uncanny and the camera gets way too close to them most of the time which only makes it worse. The second they appear the film goes straight into the uncanny valley and even though they remain a jolly highlight throughout as they did in the original, it's never enough to fully escape it. It's such a strange (at best) creative choice however, the new character arc given to Dopey really works.

Marc Webb's direction is completely authorless and it makes no sense that he'd choose to make this after the notoriously tumultuous production of his Amazing Spider-Man duology under Sony. There's some vibrant sequences and it's generally pretty colourful, only employing a bland grey palette for scenes where it kinda fits. The flat choreography is counterbalanced by the new songs which fit better than they usually do.",6/10
"I went into Snow White (2025) hoping for a fresh, bold take on a beloved classic - what I got was a muddled, joyless retelling that strips away the charm, magic, and emotional depth of the original.

First off, the writing is painfully bland. The script tries so hard to be modern and ""empowering"" that it forgets to actually tell a compelling story. Snow White herself comes off less like a heroine and more like a confused side character in her own tale. The dwarfs - or whatever this version tries to call them - are barely fleshed out and feel like afterthoughts. And don't get me started on the villain: a one-dimensional caricature with no real menace or intrigue.",1/10
"We gave it a shot-my entire family sat down genuinely hoping Snow White (2025) would be worth the time. It wasn't. The film is an unwatchable mess, a complete butchering of the original story that seems more focused on making a statement than telling a coherent tale. It abandons everything that made the classic beloved, replacing heart and imagination with awkward messaging and shallow characters. The visuals are equally disastrous. The animation quality is shockingly poor for a modern production; I've seen more polished work from indie studios over a decade ago. Worse, it's visually inconsistent-flipping between cartoonish slapstick and jarring attempts at hyper-realism, leaving the viewer confused about what kind of world this is supposed to be. There's no magic here, just a clumsy, soulless product that doesn't seem to know what audience it's even aiming for. This was the final straw for me. I already canceled Netflix and Prime Video over similarly disappointing content-and now, Disney's going next. If this is the future of their storytelling, I want no part in it.",1/10
"The new movie S. L. O. W. (Spectacularly Lame, Outdated, and Wretched) left me feeling B. O. R. E. D. (Blatantly Overdone, Repetitive, and Empty). The actors? P. L. E. A. S. E. (Pathetically Lacking Effort and Skill, Emotionally). It's a shame they couldn't hire anyone with A. C. T. (Authentic Charisma and Talent). Overall, a D. U. D. (Disappointingly Uninspired Disaster) that reflects the soulless state of current cinema.

The real tragedy isn't just this D. U. D. (Disappointingly Uninspired Disaster), but the children who went in expecting a fairy tale and instead witnessed Hollywood's rotten core on full display. These kids deserved magic, yet were handed a soulless cash grab-another crime in T. I. N. S. E. L. (Talentless Industry Nurturing Shameless Exploitation and Lies). Bad apples keep spoiling the orchard, and the industry keeps selling them as golden. Where is the A. U. T. H. E. N. T. I. C. I. T. Y.?

"It's disappointing that Disney is no longer making movies like it used to. I gave this one a chance thinking it would have learned from the other live action movies but it was a huge fail. Mulan's live action for instance lacked magic and what existed in the original, it's the same for all of the other live actions they lack the magic and what makes it unforgettable. They get rid of the good things and replace them with things that didn't even exist in the original and not for good reasons either. Snow white was a very boring experience, it lack magic and ruined many characters with CGI as well.",1/10
"Worst movie ever. Story was incredibly changed , and her acting was awful throughout the movie . Gal gadot is the only reason to watch the movie . Still the movie is too cringy ...!

Snow White is supposed to be a kind, gentle, and lovable character, but Zegler's version comes across as arrogant and unlikable.

Her line delivery lacks emotion, and there's no real charm or innocence in her portrayal. In key emotional moments, she fails to bring depth.

One of the biggest issues with this film is how drastically it deviates from the source material. Instead of a tale about kindness, innocence, and overcoming adversity, this version turns Snow White into a self-proclaimed leader who has no interest in love, dwarfs, or even the core themes that made the original special.",1/10
"Dear Disney and cast, If you don't like the original story, write your own-don't hijack a beloved tale just to cash in on its name while stripping it of its charm. This version distances itself so far from the heart of the original that it ends up feeling hollow and confused, disappointing both long-time fans and newcomers.

The biggest issue at the heart of this film is a complete disregard for what made the original beloved. Instead of embracing the magic, innocence, and simple charm of the original classic, this version seems almost embarrassed by its own source material.

And the result? A film that alienates longtime fans, fails to inspire new ones, and now holds the dubious honour of one of the lowest-rated remakes in recent memory.",1/10

"Disney's Snow White fails to live up to expectations both in storytelling and execution. From weak 2025 CGI and uninspired performances to a lack of emotional depth, the movie struggles to justify its existence. The casting controversy surrounding Rachel Zegler set a negative tone before release, and unfortunately, the film itself does little to redeem it. The dwarfs' CGI is unimpressive, the plot lacks cohesion, and the performances, despite a strong cast, feel flat. Ultimately, Snow White feels more like a forgettable low-budget streaming release rather than a major Disney film.

At the end of the day, this was just a boring cash grab.",1/10
"It's the worst Disney princess movie for all time. How can they ruined the legend in such a way most of the people feel sick. The previous you may find enjoyment and happiness. In this one the characters are so weak and you remembered no one after you watched the movie. The story is not make sense. There's no growing path of snow white. If she is so strong why doesn't she try to fight in the castle in the beginning. And the Queen was died by the broken mirror? Its not an acceptable ending.

The parts which are good is, the voice of snow white is not bad but you wont memories any song after the movie. CG of the animals are good. And thats all.",1/10
"Movie completely misses the mark. While it tries to appeal to modern sensibilities, the result is a dull and uninspired retelling of the classic. The once magical elements are now lifeless, and the over-reliance on CGI makes the world feel artificial rather than enchanting. The film drags on with long, unnecessary scenes that leave you checking the time.

What's worse is that even children, who are the target audience, seemed uninterested and restless. The movie's attempt at humor is forced, and the characters, especially Snow White, are one-dimensional. The dwarfs, who were supposed to be quirky and lovable, feel flat and unremarkable. There's no heart in this version, and it struggles to capture the essence of the original tale, leaving viewers-young and old-feeling bored and disconnected.

"The pacing was slow, and the plot felt disjointed. The characters lacked depth, making it hard to connect with them emotionally. Snow White herself seemed more like a background character in her own story.

The musical numbers, which I hoped would be a highlight, were forgettable and didn't add anything meaningful to the narrative. The visuals were nice, but they couldn't compensate for the lackluster writing and uninspired direction.

"I don't usually leave reviews, but this movie was so unbelievably bad I had to say something. I actually paid to see the new Snow White-and I walked out not even halfway through. That should tell you everything. The acting, especially from Snow White herself, was painful to watch. She didn't embody the charm, grace, or warmth of the classic character at all. Instead, they turned her into someone completely unrecognizable, stripping away everything iconic about her. It felt forced, awkward, and totally off-tone.

Movie has no soul, all the CGI looks really bad, feels like low production even tho they clamin to have spent 230 million on it, I don't really know where did they spend all that money to be honest.

Snow White's dress looks like it was bought from a OP shop down the road from party costume that no one wanted.

It's a remake that no one asked, why not just stick to the original story? Where are the colours on the movie? Disney movies are suposed to be bright and colourful.

When did Snow White turned into a Girl Boss... what wrong with true love and compassion from the original movie?

The acting is not good, the cgi is horrible, the dwarfs where scary, the story didn't make sense...

The complete abandonment of the fairytale's story is incredibly disappointing, as now it is a misguided and soulless dumpster fire. Even the CGI for the dwarves was worse than I thought it was going to be. For a 270 million dollar budget you'd think Disney could have put together something that wasn't acid to the eyes. If you want a new story, make a new story-don't take a pre-loved classic and turn it into a hollow, lifeless mess. This is easily one of the worst things to come from the Disney studios.",1/10

She can really sing well and embodies Snow White in a very lovely way. Her hair is short because the evil queen cuts it like that out of jealousy. Speaking of the evil queen I thought Gal Gadot was great too and sang well in her number. It had the perfect touch of camp while still being evil. The entire score is really hummable - heigh ho and whistle while you work were great as well as the new waiting on a wish. It was a misstep to not include the gorgeous ""One Song"" from the original - it could have been worked in despite lack of a prince. There are just a lot of things I think were not that bad once I actually saw the film like the backgrounds and costumes. The one big mistake was in not using human actors for the dwarves. They could have changed the appearance as was done in the Tolkien films. The love interest who is an actor turned thief is fine as well. And Dopey was probably my favorite character.",8/10
"The movie is ok, the songs are good and the animation is excellent! People are being very strict. They make it seem that the story could only be performed in a spectacular film. It's an old and well-known story. To expect more than what you have there, is to fantasize more than the tale itself. Again I say that the animation is very good, and does justice to the first film, which has a spectacular animation for the time. This average score ends up revealing more about the people voting than about the film itself. Remember the message... more beautiful than the brightness of great productions is to keep hearts and minds open!",6/10
"This movie gave my grandma the final push to get up and pull the plug herself. I knew it was a shameless cash grab but watched it anyways. To no surprise I saw mediocre acting and poor storytelling blended with bad CGI. I don't know what I feel more sad about, watching this movie or not being able to rate it in negative.

I don't care about casting choices that much as long as the actors do their job properly. It boggles my mind how is Gal Gadot still receiving movie offers with her 'exception acting skills'. Rachel Zegler is still a kid (I didn't expect much from her anyways). Such a popular Disney classic adored by millions of fans including me didn't deserve a live action adaptation this poor. Pull the plug on these kinds of movies Disney, please.",1/10
"Beautiful Rachel Zegler's voice (she definitely has some talent) could have been a great fit for this movie if it weren't for her not-so-suitable for this tale look and terrible personality, which ruined the beloved fairytale for so many. Awful casting all around. An awful product in general.

The 1937 Disney classic, itself an adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairytale, is cherished for its simplicity and charm that is Snow White is a gentle, pure-hearted princess who finds refuge with the seven dwarfs and is ultimately saved by a prince. This version reimagines her as a more proactive, leader-driven figure who teams up with bandits and dwarfs to overthrow her stepmother, the Evil Queen. How about the Disney write its own script for a new women empowerment movie instead? And don't call this /awfully done/ movie the Snow White.

Needs to be re-done! I can't take my kids to watch this and train them for an awful taste in movies.",1/10
"This remake is beyond disappointing - it is a complete travesty. Not only does it obliterate the heart and soul of the original, it shamelessly disrespects everything that made Snow White a timeless classic. The storytelling is flat, the visuals are uninspired, and the characters feel hollow and forced. It's painfully obvious that this was created with no real love or respect for the source material. Watching it felt like witnessing a cherished childhood dream being torn apart in slow motion. It is not just forgettable - it's offensively bad. This film is a cultural nightmare that never should have been greenlit. It's a slap in the face to fans who grew up with the magic of the original. Disney has truly lost its way. Avoid this at all costs - this movie doesn't just ruin memories, it leaves a bad taste that lingers.",1/10
"Have to say is in what world would someone as stunning as Gal Gadot be jealous of Rachel Zegler. You set Snow up for failure with that alone. Stripping away the magical wonder of the original story and creating something with such poor writing, casting, and effects feels like nothing but a cash grab. It's another ""we have to change the classic it doesn't fit modern standards."" Which no... It doesn't it's not 1937 anymore but it's a classic. Make a new movie with a new story but leave the classic we all know and love alone. Changing the story to have a person of a different color and to be a ""strong independent woman"" doesn't make a film good. I want my time back after this one.",1/10
"The whole attitude seemed different and muddy. It just didn't make alot of sense. Ths cgi was odd and felt rushed with little to no character feeling. Why didn't they use real dwarves, I thought it was supposed to be ""live action remake"" While half the movie was fake characters. The storyline doesn't match the original at all. It seems it would have been best for them to make a new movie instead of trying to resell it as an ""improved live action remake""

In the end My Mom asked me what I thought about it, I told her it was:

""Weird, weird.""

She just looked at me. I said don't bother watching it.",1/10
"Stay away.

Disney is making worst decisions in history.

Movie was trash.

The effects were bad and the story was mediocre at best.

Something my daughter was eager to see but slept through it.

She seriously asked if this is what I grew up on and thankfully responded with a resounding 'No'.

I hope Disney jiat sticks with the original script and doesn't deviate.

Tried to give it a chance but hard when the main actor was knocking the original formula and putting so many people off. Disney should be ashamed of themselves of trying to back her up and not listen to fans from the beginning. This damage control now is too little too late.",1/10
"Title: A Dismal Attempt at Magic

Review: ""Snow White"" (2025) is an unfortunate reminder of how far Disney has strayed from its roots. The film is a pure misfire, featuring an unbearable performance by the lead actress who struggles to convey even a hint of charm or depth. The once-beloved fairy tale is dragged down by uninspired dialogue and absurd attempts at modern relevance that fall flat. Everybody can easily how bad the CGI are just from the trailer so no need to deepen on this.

Rather than enchanting audiences, this version feels like a tedious obligation, making every sane person long for the classic storytelling and whimsical animation that made Disney shine. It's probably their last chance to stop this insanity or just go broke.",1/10

"To be honest I enjoyed most of it, the story was nice it looked almost exactly like the original cartoon, it had so much detail and it's very fantasyland, the actress voice is amazing I just wish she acted a bit more like Snow White and the dress from Disney land looks better than the movie I don't know why the dress from this live action has long sleeves and it looks a bit simple also They decided to add random songs instead of one of the best original songs from the wishing well but I do recommend this movie to everyone because it was very cute and entertaining even though people seem to dislike it.",8/10
"Snow White is the newest Disney live action remake, and it isn't bad. But could be better. The most controversial part about this film is Rachel Zegler, but she is the best part of this movie. The girl knows how to sing (like we saw on hunger games, and other films), and she sings beautifully in this movie. Speaking of singing, the songs in this movie aren't bad. Most of the Disney life action remake don't have good original songs but when you switch over to this movie, there's actually a handful amount of them that I find really good and catchy. Now Gal Gadot is getting hated in this movie saying it is her worst performance yet but the way I see it. She almost matched the role of the evil queen perfectly, now I do have a few Nitpicks, but I didn't hate her performance. And this movie fixed all of my problems that I had with the original film, the pacing is better in this movie and we fleshed out the characters more instead of the storylines being rushed. All my problems with the original film isn't in this movie, so theoretically that will make this movie better than the original. But this movie introduced new problems that stop it from being better than the original. First off the movie feels like a completely different story. It has the Snow White story in there, but the overall story with the evil queen and Snow White royalty is completely different and just doesn't match the classic that we know. Makes it feel like a completely different movie and that they only put Snow White in this movie so that people went out and saw it. Earlier I did talk about Gal Gadot and how she matched the evil queen almost perfectly with her performance. But her singing sounds awful in here, I never liked the song She's singing in this movie and her performance doesn't help. She's singing in the way that doesn't really match the evil queen. And the song just sounds completely off and the song just feels forced into the movie. I do think the first hour of this movie is really solid, but the second half of the movie is where it started to really go downhill. Partially because that's where the new story comes into play, but it also captured none of the magic that the original Snow White movie had. And the romance just felt forced, it felt like they only had the romance in there just for snow White to wake up from the poison apple. And the CGI dwarfs don't look as bad as they did in the trailer, but they still don't look good. I don't understand why they didn't hire an actual person to play the role instead of the CGI dwarfs. But overall, Snow White still at least captures the same magic that the original classic had, and fixing a lot of my problems that I had of the original movie. But they changed so much of the story that it just doesn't feel like the same movie anymore and feels like a completely different movie, but a boring plot that doesn't capture the same magic that the original movie had. And at the end of the day comes off as an another boring live action remake.",6/10
Bad CGI and disjointed story line. A waste of money. This move is just bad. I had hopes Disney would have fixed some of it but no. And to end the move with a ditty style white party. How out of touch is Disney? Then the seven abominations ie dwarfs. Just wow I've seen better cgi for cheep vido games. So do not waste your time or money on this movie. Now to the star of the show... bold choice to go all in on your hate of a timeless Disney classic that you are now remaking. And you wonder why people are not going to see your dumpster fire of a movie. So Disney loves to make box offline bombs now. I hope they don't mess up Leo and Stitch.,1/10
"This is disappointing... Childhood stories are obliterated left and right. Stories changing over and over ... At this point quit doing ""live actions"" and just make completely new movies with these ideas. This does not even begin to address the hate filled star playing a timeless princess. Why would someone want their children to look up said 'star' and read the things she has said of and about to others. I feel Disney REALLY dropped the bomb on this one, sadly I believe more than they did on the little mermaid. Atleast Hallie wasn't hate filled and had a beautiful voice that aligned with Ariel.",1/10
"Disney, what is this? Besides the fact that it has lost all its magic and originality, this so-called Snow White looks nothing like the original character. It's honestly baffling how far you've strayed from what made these movies special. But what makes it even worse is your decision to cast someone who was part of the Israeli military as a princess in a movie that KIDS will be watching. How do you expect people to overlook the fact that she actively served in a force known for its role in oppression and destruction? Kids deserve better role models, and this choice is beyond disrespectful.

Disney used to be about wonder, innocence, and timeless stories that brought joy to children and families alike. Now, it's nothing but a soulless cash grab that disregards everything that made it great. You took a beloved fairytale and stripped it of everything meaningful, replacing it with corporate nonsense. It's not just disappointing-it's infuriating. A completely shameful decision. Don't waste your time watching this.",1/10
"I really dislike the movie. The CGI is unconvincing and distracting, making it hard to stay immersed in the story. The performances are flat and lack the emotional depth needed to connect with the characters. Additionally, the music is uninspired and fails to bring any memorable charm to the film. The plot is disjointed and uninspired, not capturing the magic of the original tale. Overall, every element-from visuals and acting to music and storyline-falls short, leaving me thoroughly disappointed with this adaptation. In summary, this adaptation is an unredeemable attempt that completely misses its mark, failing to honor the timeless spirit of the original classic.",1/10
"Completely strays away from the original story completely. Snow white is also portrayed as a very 'sassy' character with an attitude problem.

Aside from some of the songs being catchy, it was hard to watch, without falling asleep.

The story behind the name Snow white, is different. Despite there being 7 dwarves in the film, they were unconvincing, and would have been better to cast actual actors to play them instead of CGI.

The evil witch played by Gal Gadot was average in terms of acting, but again, the storyline of her was very much different to the original story.

Despite the bad press this film has had, I thought I'd give it a try. And it was as bad as hyped to be.",1/10
"When you want to do something so different... just create a new character.

Violating the existing ones is not art. The story, the main characters, the whole idea of the storytelling... altered to the core.

Refreshing is good... enhancing also... but changing it so intensively and forcefully to pass messages by any means necessary... no... is completely unnecessary.

It is disrespectful for the all generations. The ones who created this story, watched it, learned from it, enjoyed it, read it to their kids and grandkids.

Doesn't make sense. As I said in the beginning... just create a new character. Don't be lazy and create disappointments.",1/10
"This is even worse than Disney's the Marvels. The lead actress was so bad. Gal Gadot was better suited to be Snow White. Disney must put an end to their string of ugly movies. The quality and storytelling was something you could get off youtube. It's not worth paying movie tickets for or a disney+ subscription for. Don't waste your money and time on this. Money that you lose you can earn back but time that you lose you can never earn back anymore. This was such a waste of time. Save your money, save your kids from disappointment don't watch this film. The acting was also bad. Gal gadot was the only brightspot in the film.",1/10
"I love Disney and have an open mind. I don't care about political controversy. My family and I just want to be entertained accordingly for our time and money. This movie fell short in every way. Do better, Disney. The wheel does not always need to be reinvented. Even my 9-year-old daughter was disappointed. The original Disney movies are generally fantastic and on point, including the original Snow White.

This remake was poorly executed. Nobody at Disney saw potential failure with this? Is everyone asleep over there? Save your money people, I wouldn't even pay to see it at home. It was that boring!",1/10
"Solid 7.5/10

Saw it today with my littles (14, 8, 3) and a friend/their kids (7, 3) and we all enjoyed it.

The songs were great. The singing was fantastic. The nostalgia was there. The changes made sense.

The worst part was the CGI - the dwarves were weird looking and so were some of the forest creatures.

There wasn't much back story to the evil queen, which could have been fun.

Didn't love the haircut and the way the costume translated, but otherwise Rachel was amazing. But that was the point of the haircut right? A way for the evil queen to contain her beauty?

Looking forward to watching again on Disney+ in the future.",8/10
"Ouch! Now this was always going to be a difficult story to imaginatively reimagine, and I do wonder just who Disney thought this was for as it quite radically alters the timeless fairy tale and augments it with some remarkably unremarkable power ballads and set piece choreography that wouldn't have looked out of place at a barn dance. This iteration of the story pretty much abandons the fantasy elements of the original one and tells us of a wicked queen who has tricked her way onto the throne and turned the princess ""Snow White"" (Rachel Zegler) into something more akin to a royal ""Cinderella"". Luckily for her, she encounters the enthusiastic bandit ""Jonathan"" (Andrew Burnap) who has broken into the palace to pinch some spuds, and next thing they are both trying to stay one step ahead of the Queen (Gal Gadot) who is narked by her mirror telling her she's just plain ugly so she wants them deceased! It does swing by the brothers Grimm every now and again, and there are seven singing dwarves to ""work the whole day long"", but even they can't breathe much life into this surprisingly mundane exercise in superb technical creativity but otherwise lacklustre amateur stage theatricals. The unmistakably familiar score from Messrs. Pasek and Paul keeps threatening to break into ""You Will Be Found"" from ""Dear Evan Hansen"" and aside from, perhaps, ""Waiting on a Wish"" the soundtrack - like the whole thing - is disappointingly forgettable as it avoids every potential hint of menace progressing through a fondue of gloop towards it's conclusion. Thank heavens for ""Grumpy"" (Martin Kleppa) who is probably the only one on-screen in synch with those of us watching. If you do want to see it then cinema is definitely best. This will look and sound bland and forgettable on the telly, but will fit excellently with the other banal recent additions to Disney+.",6/10
"First time I'v walked out of a movie, I realized I would rather be doing literally anything other than sitting there and watching it. Played video games instead and it was a good decision. The film shouldn't have been made, the writing, acting, casting is all just terrible, I'm trying to give it one redeeming quality but none comes to mind. Disney could give me a third of the budget they used to film this and I could make them a hit! How hard is it to follow the original story line and give the people what they want to see? In a world of remakes not being better than the original this one has to bat the very top of the list of failures.",1/10
"Bad acting. Bad music. Bad CGI. Bad Plot. Bad story. Bad film. Awful on all accounts. I hope I never have to sit through a movie Gadot or Zegler again. New careers for them are needed. Why is Snow White belting like Elsa? Where is her soft spoken, cutesy voice with angelic high vocals. Every line that comes out of Zeglers mouth is completely cringeworthy, she's way too musical theatre for even a musical. Her type of acting only really works on stage or for a kids film. Whilst Zegler is cringe, Gadot is just a terrible actress. But this was not news to me. Don't bother seeing this. I wish I hadn't.",1/10
"Snow White (2025) : Movie Review -

Disney is approaching its centennial, and over these 100 years, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) continues to be the BIGGEST HIT they ever produced (109 million tickets sold in North America). Unsure why they decided to redo the iconic film after 90 years, only to tarnish their own legacy. Snow White is a cheerful movie, until you reach the climax, which kills it more than the poisoned apple ever could. Even though it's a borrowed tale, you'll observe the alterations and additions in the script and wonder, ""who approved these clichés?""

In the opening scene, if the younger version of Snow White appears more beautiful than the adolescent version of Snow White, then you've started off on the wrong foot, mate. If the magic mirror reveals that Rachel Zegler is more beautiful and fairer than Gal Gadot, then you certainly have a problematic product on your hands. If your movie doesn't conclude with the ""true love kiss,"" you've really failed it. If the Evil Queen can be vanquished through conversation, then I have no interest, Marc brother.

The tale of Snow White, as everyone knows, revolves around Snow White (both externally and internally) who is turned into a servant by the Evil Queen. The Evil Queen has taken great pride in being the fairest of all, but her arrogance is shattered when the magic mirror reveals that Snow White is the fairest. The Queen now desires Snow White, also known as the Princess, to be dead, but she is granted life by her killer and is left to reside in an enchanted forest. The princess seeks refuge in the sole house she spots, owned by seven dwarfs, each representing a different human emotion-Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey. The princess is looking for her father but the dwarfs ask her to stay here, stay safe; will she listen?

In contrast to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, this remake portrays the Prince in a new way-as a Rebel, specifically speaking. Why the hell did you do that? As stated earlier, the true Love's kiss seems ineffective as it doesn't create that singular ideal moment of a ""perfect Happy ending."" The film runs longer from there. Snow White's musical pieces are effective at certain moments, but others can be very dull. Certain dialogues are also not positioned effectively. Quite reminiscent of the legendary conversation between Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart about ""how to whistle"" in ""To Have and Have Not"" (1944), our Snow White instructs Dopey and the other dwarfs on the same topic, namely, ""how to whistle."" That appeared adorable, however. Additionally, numerous scenes in the movie appeared delightful and joyful, including the introduction of animals, the opening song featuring the seven dwarfs, and the house cleaning sequence. On the downside, the film overlooked some stunning scenes from the original, with my favorite being Snow White's joyful gathering with birds and animals at home.

Regarding performances, I think Snow White had the potential to be much better than how the actors have portrayed it. Rachel Zegler appears excessively white and fair, yet she was decent overall. Gal Gadot's accent appeared more English this time, surprisingly, yet the character didn't resonate effectively. Andrew Burnap portrays the new character, who, despite his satisfactory to reasonable performance, appears entirely out of place in the context. The backing of Ansu Kabia, Patrick Page, and Hadley Fraser was barely perceptible, while all those seven dwarfs appeared cute on occasion but visually unappealing at other times. One cannot be so childish with a $250 million budget film.

Snow White lacks captivating music and visual charm, which are essential for any live-action adaptation. Disney is undoubtedly running low on concepts, which is why they are recreating many of their legendary blockbusters. I firmly believe that Snow White wasn't the appropriate choice for the remake era. The visual effects are even worse than you'd imagine, and the casting of Zegler and Gadot in specific roles is surely one of the biggest F-ups in recent memory. Marc Webb's contemporary take on the cult classic nearly won me over; indeed, Disney's Snow White was almost a winner, until it lost to its own potential and legacy. The final 20-25 minutes of the film have turned it into a terrible remake by far; I mean, it completely lost me during that part. If there were no Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, then Snow White could have possibly worked for me. But what would Disney have been without Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? I suppose nothing. However, Disney without Snow White would have had ""no impact"" on the world. So, skip watching it if you cherish, admire, and honor the original. Let Disney suffer.

RATING - 4/10*",4/10
"Title says it all. Just dont watch. Its not even interestingly bad. Its just annoying to sit through. Terrible on every level. I can generate a better movie using AI.

The movie was a disappointment, with underdeveloped characters and clunky dialogue. The pacing was slow and unengaging, leading to a lackluster viewing experience. Overall, it felt shallow and failed to leave a lasting impact.

Acting was extremely uninspired, making it hard to connect emotionally. The entire film felt like a missed opportunity. What an absolute waste. I havent wanted to complain more about wasted time than after this absolute trainwreck.

This will be remade and RECAST in very short order. Guaranteed. Please delete this from the collective consciousness.",1/10
"I desperately wanted to give this Snow White movie 0 stars, but IMDb forces me to settle for a measly 1. This film is an utter trainwreck. The acting is stiff and lifeless, as if the cast was half-asleep. The dialogue is so cringe-worthy it physically hurts, and the plot meanders aimlessly, stretching a simple story into a tedious, unbearable slog. The special effects are cheap and dated think awful CGI from a decade ago and the costumes look like rejects from a high school play. Even the classic apple scene lacks any tension or magic. It's a soulless cash grab that tarnishes the fairy tale. Skip it and save your sanity.",1/10
"Watched it for free from a friend who works at amc and it was bad, glad I didn't pay to see this ☝🏽 but never again will I see a Disney movie like this, sure hope they don't mess up lilo and stitch. That's the only movie i'm coming in to see since that's my day one there but yeah horrible movie and I feel bad for those who are paying high price tickets to watch Snow White. Overall don't watch it as Disney should know our generation is evolving and should stop using old fairy tales to make profit as they been successful with their other movies and they should keep it that way but yeah horrible movie.",1/10
"What happened to the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s era when Disney made solid movies that were classics for decades?

I'd rather dry shave with the dull side of a butter knife than watch another Disney movie.

We went as a family to see this long anticipated version of Snow White, only to discover that it was poorly made and acted. Disney has gotten lazy, hired awful writers, and lastly seems to care about profit margins only.

Disney has disappointed us on so many different occasions these days that I've decided, as a family, that Disney is off our radar now permanently. We'll spend our time and money somewhere else.",1/10
"Everyone is out to put this movie and actors down. But it honestly was not that bad. There are way worse movies and remakes out there. But because of politics this movie is getting bashed. Was it Oscar worthy no. Was it different yes so are all the other live actions. My kids liked it because of the music and animals. We liked it because they did and we enjoyed watching a pretty movie that was cute. Instead of bringing it down watch it yourself and make your own opinion. Everyone is hating on it but it's still a cute movie with some beautiful scenes and beautiful music that's not the same as the original and that's fine. There's still the same plot, there's still a prince and he helps her and she helps him. She did amazing singing and the dwarves were not scary or weird. Again there's been weirder and worse elsewhere. There is still kindness in this movie which is what Snow White exuded.",8/10
"Okay, first off I need to ask, what the heck does this have an 1.6 on IMDb??????

Seriously the rotten tomatoes score is not even single digits, how the heck is is lower then disaster movie, okay, let's talk about the movie itself, I'll admit the writing is better then most Disney live action remakes, and it is told decently well, and the songs are pretty good too, however, there are a lot of problems, especially the cgi dwarfs, oh my god, they look ugly as hell, and the hi ho version in here sucks, now as the voice acting, it's not as bad as I thought here and they did put some effort here, but it's far from being considered great, for me recommendation, it's best to just wait till it comes out on Disney+, it's better to watch it on a smaller screen then a theater, hi ho, hi..... okay?",6/10
"My perceptive: Overall boring movie were most of it felt very forced to fit a narrative. Chi wassnt necessary and didn't feel like they put any effort into it. Bloated characters were they had the opportunity to use real people to make the movie diverse without crashing the original saga.

My children's notes: Both my girls were not enjoying the movie, they felt no connection to it and both of them was sad that they felt no ""princess"" vibe, the only thing they absolutely love with all these Disney princesses... and even they question the ending.

Outfit looked bad, straight from an Temu warehouse, had parts were it could have been good but got swooped back to the dumpster fire the movie truly was. Not worth the time.",2/10
"Let's be honost. Walt Disney would never have allowed this to happen. What is wrong with Disney today ? How can they put so much money is a movie which everybody knew it was doomed from the beginning ? Ok, Zegler can sing but making her Snow White was the worst idea in the history of bad ideas. Using CGI for the dwarfs ? Come on ! I was hoping at least Gal Gadot would save this movie but she was overacting all the time. This movie is terrible. Walked out of the theatre after 40 minutes. Couldn't bare it anymore... Came home, got me a cold beer and watched a good old pixar movie to save my evening.",2/10
"One of the worst films I have ever seen, completely removed from the traditionally family friendly oriented Disney movies. The performance of Zegler was arguably still better than some co-stars, Disney has a problem in understanding her public.

The mixing of the music is very bad, cinematography is not adding to the story, the white costume party very unbelievable and psychotic in nature.

I went with my kids and even they didn't like it whatsoever, they are watching cheap 3D movies all the time. The musical composition is very predictable, if you can hear the notes due to the very bad mixing.

Not recommended, also for children.",2/10
"The recent Snow White remake, unfortunately, falls short of capturing the charm and heart of the original Disney classic. While it attempts to modernize the story, the film seems to prioritize contemporary themes over the fundamental aspects that made the original tale so beloved.

One of the main issues with this remake is its shift in focus from Snow White's personal growth and her relationships with the dwarfs to more modern, preachy themes about independence and self-reliance. These themes feel forced and detract from the emotional core of the story. The original Snow White was a symbol of kindness and resilience, and these qualities are less emphasized here, which makes the character feel less relatable and harder to root for.

The portrayal of Snow White in this version is another point of concern. While the actress delivers her performance with determination, the character's warmth and innocence-key to the original-are largely absent. Instead of an endearing figure, Snow White here feels more like a character shaped by modern ideals rather than the timeless virtues that made her stand out in the classic.

Similarly, the Evil Queen, once a complex and menacing villain, is reduced to a less compelling figure. Her motivations feel unclear, and the character lacks the depth and menace that made her such a memorable antagonist in the original film.

The film's attempt to infuse social commentary into the narrative is another area where it struggles. While it's important for films to reflect societal values, the messages in this remake often feel overly forced, detracting from the story rather than enhancing it. It's clear that the intention was to create a more empowering story, but the execution leaves much to be desired.

Visually, the film is polished and colorful, but its flashy aesthetics can't mask the lack of emotional depth. There's a sense that the filmmakers were more concerned with spectacle than with crafting a story that resonates with audiences on a deeper level.

Ultimately, while this Snow White remake offers a fresh take, it doesn't quite live up to the spirit of the original. It prioritizes modern themes over the timeless qualities of the classic story, which may leave long-time fans disappointed.",1/10
"Disney's live-action Snow White fails to capture the magic of the original. The writing feels uninspired, the changes to the story seem forced, and the characters lack charm. The CGI is underwhelming, making the world feel artificial rather than enchanting. The lead performance is forgettable, and the iconic moments lose their emotional impact. The film tries to modernize the story but instead strips away its heart. Instead of celebrating a beloved classic, it feels like a soulless cash grab. Disney should focus on originality rather than remaking films with less passion. A disappointing and unnecessary adaptation.",1/10
"If there was an Oscar for most overrated movie of all time this absolute shambles of a so called movie would win it.

The so called acting was abysmal, I've honestly seen better acting at day care centre Christmas play. These so called actors would be better off getting acting lessons from the children because they're 100 more times better than these so called movie stars. If this is the best that they can do with such a huge budget then I have serious concerns for these so called Disney executives who decided to go ahead with this movie.

Everything from start to finish was terrible. The best part was was walking out at the end and buying a ticket to see a different movie.",1/10
"I just watched Disney's latest live-action remake of Snow White, and honestly, it was a huge letdown. As someone who grew up loving the original animated classic, I went in hoping for at least a visually stunning and heartfelt adaptation, but what I got was a bland, uninspired mess that completely missed the magic of the original.

A Snow White That Doesn't Feel Like Snow White Right from the start, the film felt... off. The casting of Rachel Zegler as Snow White was controversial for many reasons, but for me, it wasn't just about appearances. She lacked the charm, innocence, and warmth that made the original Snow White so beloved. Instead of being the sweet and kind princess we remember, this version of Snow White comes off as overly modernized and unrelatable. And don't even get me started on the decision to remove the classic love story-why strip away one of the most iconic elements of the original?",1/10
"I approached the film with low expectations, but what awaited me there undercut even these. This film is not just a failed remake - it is a prime example of how to distort a timeless classic beyond recognition. The magic of the original has been replaced by sterile images, lifeless acting and a plot that is clearly ashamed of its own identity.

Rachel Zegler as Snow White comes across as consistently distant, almost as if she doesn't believe in the story she's telling. Her performance lacks warmth, and any form of charisma is sorely missing. And while her voice has potential, the songs remain pale and forgettable the moment they fade. The musical magic of the original? Gone without a trace.

Gal Gadot, who visually fits the role of the Evil Queen without question, delivers a performance that swings between overacted pathos and emotionless routine. She's neither frightening nor fascinating - just completely out of place. Her scenes feel more like a fashion campaign with dialogue than a film performance.

What shocked me most was the visual execution. Despite the enormous budget, the film looks like an overlong commercial from post-production hell. The CGI depiction of the ""dwarfs"" (if we're even allowed to call them that anymore) is so artificial, I felt secondhand embarrassment. These figures have neither charm nor personality - they are mere digital shadows of once-beloved characters.

But the film's biggest flaw lies in its core attitude: instead of developing the story or respectfully reinterpreting it, it goes out of its way to distance itself from the original - and in doing so, completely loses its emotional core. The romantic component is sacrificed for ideological reasons without offering anything of equal value in return. What remains is a narrative that neither moves nor inspires.

Throughout the entire runtime, I kept asking myself why this film even exists. Anyone who loves the original should avoid this soulless product at all costs. Disney hasn't just missed an opportunity here - they've damaged a cultural legacy. Too bad about the time - and even more about the memory.",1/10
"There were many aspects of this movie that went above and below expectations. As someone who was ecstatic about this movie, it was a little underwhelming, but it did have its positives.

On one hand, the movie was overall entertaining. The ""Waiting on a Wish"" and ""A Hand Meets a Hand"" were catchy additions to the soundtrack, and the additions to the storyline fit well within Disney's intentions to modernize them and add to the classic. For example, expanding upon the love interests involvement in the story and making him less of a random guy that shows up to kiss her eventually was a good way to make his involvement in the film less random. Developing their relationship gave more meaning to her awakening. Visually, the CGI for the mines and the forest scene were pretty cool. I also liked how they made the dwarfs more interesting as creatures. That is about as far as the positives for the film extend.

There was a lot to unpack with the negative parts of the movie. The Evil Queen's performance felt forced, flat, and just overall hard to watch. Snow White's hair has its ups and downs, but ultimately looked like lord farquaad when it mattered. The CGI dwarfs were kind of spooky, but not that bad. I understand what people mean when they say that you could tell that everything was sets, but that shouldn't take away from the details in the sets such as with the outside and inside of the cottage. The chemistry between Snow White and Johnathan was a little awkward. No, I don't think Snow White's outfit was horrendous and hideous. I actually liked that they gave her ballet shoes, because who is actually running around a Forrest in heels and not losing them?

The biggest things to remember are that first of all, these movies aren't just for fans of the original, but also for children who just want to see real-life princesses, and that this was a reimagining more than a remake. If you watch the movie, keep your standards to a minimum. If you pick apart everything about the movie, of course you're not going to enjoy it. Just watch it for what it is: a princess movie to watch with your kids as they sing along with the songs that they now get to grow up with.",6/10
"As always, whenever there's a negative hype around a movie, my mindset is always, prove them wrong, give it a chance.

It's diabolical, honestly, I can't understand how so much money and so much time has gone into this, the final result is cringe worthy. It is an absolute shocker, I am stumped to find any positives.

It looks and feels so artificial, the sets, the animals, as for The Dwarves themselves, I have no words to express my feelings there.

What has happened to Disney? Zero originality. Also., not what I was expecting (and I expected nothing good from this....) if I'm honest, the worst offender, Gal Gadot, she looks sensational, but her performance, she's going to scoop some unwanted awards it's fair to say.

What I wasn't expecting, was just how poor the costumes would look on screen, Snow White's just doesn't translate very well, the hairstyle, what were they. Walt would have been SOO ashamed.",1/10
"This live-action adaptation falls far short of honoring the original *Snow White*. Rather than capturing the magic and charm of the classic, it strips away everything that made the original so beloved and replaces it with poorly executed changes. The heartwarming storytelling, memorable characters, and enchanting atmosphere of the 1937 film have been replaced with a hollow and uninspired interpretation. Walt Disney would undoubtedly be disheartened to see how his timeless masterpiece has been mishandled. The production feels rushed and lacks the careful thought, artistry, and attention to detail that defined the original. From the lackluster visuals to the disjointed narrative, it's clear that this remake prioritizes quick profits over preserving the legacy of a film that once set the standard for animation and storytelling. It's a disappointing reminder that not every classic needs to be revisited-especially when the result fails to capture the essence of what made the original so special.",1/10
"Okay after watching the movie others who have not seen the classics or not a fan of the classics or even read a book about snow white would say. It's nice in a modern kind of way. But they should not have used the title if they have changed entirely the story. I have nothing against the actress or the whatever the issues are about it but it would have been nice to see a live action that is close to the Disney Classics of the original stories. For snow white it would be alive action of the 1937 movie. A lot of girls who didn't internet back in the day grew up with the Disney Princess Classics. Maybe, it would be a nice suggestion to have that live action as a way to relive those old memories of the now current mothers/grandmothers who used to love the classis. A bonding moment of mom and kids. Honest Opinion about it.",1/10
"Just terrible. Gal Gadot was the best actress by far, but it is kind of like being the best violinist on the Titanic as it goes down. Ziegler is simply unfit for a lead role in any movie. Her singing was passable, but certainly nothing outstanding and not up to so many of Disney's wonderful songs of the past. She reminds you of the people that got their lead role in the high school play because their mother knows someone. Kids were running around in the aisles playing with each other rather than watching the show, that's how bad it was. Couldn't even hold the interest of the little girls who came dressed up in their best Snow White attire. Just absolutely horrible; wretched. Big time secondhand embarrassment for Disney.",1/10
"N Disney's 2025 live-action adaptation of ""Snow White,"" Gal Gadot portrays the Evil Queen with a flamboyant and sinister flair. Her performance is marked by imposing body language and movements, effectively conveying the character's malevolence. However, some critics note that her portrayal lacks depth, with her singing and dialogue not fully capturing the character's operatic essence. Despite these critiques, Gadot's embodiment of the Evil Queen adds a campy and unrepentantly evil presence to the film.

I walked in the cinema with low expectations yet was stunned at how bad it all was. Rachel Zegler really needs to try and get into Brazzers or Hookup Hotshot. Her future would be great there. Rachel has a great body and needs to be utilised better.

Gal was great. She owned the role of the witch.",3/10
"I finally sat down to watch and, well, I wish I could say I was surprised by how dreadful it turned out to be-but I'm not. This film is an absolute trainwreck, a joyless slog that somehow manages to butcher a timeless classic while offering nothing worthwhile in return.

The script is a disaster, lurching between awkward attempts at modernizing the story and clinging to bits of the original that don't even fit anymore. They've swapped out the prince for some bandit named Jonathan (Andrew Burnap), who's about as memorable as a wet sock, and the romance feels tacked on like an afterthought. I couldn't tell if they wanted her to be a fierce leader or a swooning princess, so they just mashed both together and called it ""depth.""",1/10
"The new Snow White adaptation is a disappointing departure from the beloved classic. Stripping away the heart of the original story, it replaces timeless themes of love, resilience, and adventure with a hollow, agenda-driven narrative. The charm and whimsy that made Snow White a fairytale icon are lost in lifeless dialogue and uninspired performances. The dwarfs, once a vital part of the story, are sidelined in favor of forgettable replacements. Even the Evil Queen, a character known for her chilling presence, feels underwhelming. Instead of crafting a fresh yet respectful reimagining, this version discards the essence of what made Snow White endure for generations. It's a soulless attempt at modernization that ultimately falls flat, leaving fans with little more than disappointment.",1/10
"Just utterly bad and disappointing... what happened to Disney... it is below expectations for a film that reportedly cost more than $270m. Disney, once again, took a classic, wonderful movie and ruined it. I went to see it with my wife and we decided within 30 minutes that we would not take our children. This movie just shows that Disney is losing their creativity. Not to mention the acting is terrible. Why cast someone who doesn't respect the original film? Snow White was worse than I expected. It had no idea what it wanted to be as a movie, and Gal Gadot as the villain struggled with acting capability and failed to establish the necessary intimidating presence required for the role. The musical numbers failed to hit the mark, the CGI was substandard, and overall, the movie was just a mess. Barely deserved 1 star.",1/10
"Disney Snow White (2025):

A classic with a new touch of magic.

Great songs, enchanting images and beautifully acted and well cast roles.

Beautiful way of bringing Snow White to a new generation and as far as I'm concerned ready for transformation into a musical.

Yes, the story is different, the songs too (mostly), but I don't think that's a bad thing. There are many variations of this story made over time and (in my opinion) it keeps the experience interesting this way. The characters have more depth now and Dopey is so cute!

My advice? Go see it, be open minded and judge for yourself. :-) Have fun!",10/10
"We decided to take our kids to this as their first experience in a movie theater but we're a little skeptical prior to seeing it because of the awful reviews/feedback. We decided to go see it, regardless, and the kids enjoyed it!

After watching, I do not agree with the current 2.2/10 that is the rating. Was it the best movie I've ever watched? No. Was it the worst movie I've ever watched? Absolutely not. The ability to go in with an open mind and simply enjoy the content made the experience so much better. I think the classic components were captured well amidst the expanded plot. At the end of the day, it is a movie for kids and I think kids will enjoy it.",6/10
"Saw it today with my 7 year old. She can sit through any feature movie. Wish, frozen, tangled..and stay engaged and interested.

For this one she was bored and wanted to leave. I just went along but can say the movie looks ok, but there is no soul. Weird pacing and forced action scenes.

Main actress is almost distracting as she does not match the picture I have of Snow White.

Evil queen steals the show. Which throws a wrench in the story arc, as there is no way she would be jealous of snow whites beauty.

And why are the dwarves cgi? They look out of place in a live action movie.

Some songs and scenes are ok but overall it looks like a direct to video film.

"This movie is an absolute disaster. The image of Snow White from my childhood has been completely destroyed. If the drastic change in her character was an accident, then Rachel's poor acting is a full-blown catastrophe. Her performance is exaggerated and unnatural-it's hard to believe she was chosen as the lead. Every director, writer, and crew member who agreed to cast her should leave the film industry. How could such a beautiful character be given to someone who looks so harsh and lacks any acting skills? Thank you to whoever cast the Queen-Gal is the only highlight of this movie. But even she couldn't save it from Rachel's dreadful performance. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, hands down.",1/10
"Disney really needs to start paying attention to its audience rather than continuing to push a narrative that many fans feel disconnected from. The latest live-action adaptation of Snow White is a clear example of a missed opportunity. While Gal Gadot brings a captivating presence to her role and delivers a solid performance as the Evil Queen, Rachel Zegler falls flat as Snow White, lacking the charm and warmth that made the original character beloved. The film overall feels hollow, lacking the magic, heart, and storytelling that Disney classics are known for. It's a disappointing addition to the live-action lineup.",1/10
"I don't like to jump on the band wagon and have my opinion swayed by the masses. I'll make up my own mind thank you very much.

This film is aweful I'm sorry to say. A flat soulless film that's lost the magic of the original. Disney, you should be ashamed. You have spoilt a true classic movie by remaking it this way.

Miscast lead role. What were you thinking?

This is a movie beyond help and can't be fixed. How will Disney survive with these sort of decisions being made.

Maybe the remaking of such beloved movies should stop now and concentrate on the Disney theme parks and try not to mess them up.",1/10

This movie is awful. They missed the mark and should have left it alone. The acting was dismal and SNOW WHITE IS NOT WELL REPRESENTED BY RACHEL ZWGLER. She should go back to school to do something else. Her talent doesn't lay with acting. Gal Gadot is the true bright spot of the movie too bad they changed it because it did not need to be changed. Disney I am done with you. The basic premise of this movie had fallen flat. The screen writer did not do a good job and also did not read the room! Families loved the original Disney Snow White. You should have kept the story line and utilized the actors. The potential of the snow whitecwasvtotally disappointing. No more Disney for this family!!,1/10
"No, please... oh please, no.

I cannot even describe the level of disbelief, frustration, and outright heartbreak I experienced while watching this. No. No. NO.

It is a shame, a cinematic tragedy, that something like this was even written-let alone funded, cast, filmed, edited, and released to the public with a straight face. How did this happen? Who read the script and thought, ""Yes, this is what the world needs""? Because what we got is not a tribute, not a clever spin-it's a mockery. A farce of the highest order.

This movie isn't just a disappointment. It's a warning. A reminder that not everything old needs to be remade, especially not when the intention is to wring cheap laughs out of rich legacies.

Painful. Shallow. Embarrassing.",1/10
"My roommates and I went and saw this movie expecting the worst and were prepared to walk out if it was terrible. We were pleasantly surprised by how well Disney adapted the original Snow White while also adding the smallest twist to appeal more to younger audiences. The plot of the movie follows the original pretty closely with a couple of extra scenes added to develop Snow White and other characters. There were no major deviances from the original movie, except of the Evil Queen's death.

The musical numbers were gas, fire, flames. Genuinely the best part of the movie was anytime someone sang, which was the majority of the movie. Snow White's dress was stunning, and the Evil Queen's design was also well done. The only horrible outfit was the main guy's, but it wasn't super distracting. He was charming and convincing as Snow's love interest. Gal Gadot also did great as the Evil Queen, her performance was dramatic like a classic Disney villain and scared me just as much as the original. The color grading and cinematography were also pretty good. It did not look dull or lifeless like the Little Mermaid did.

The only major cons of this movie are the seven dwarves and the pacing. Every time the dwarves were on screen it was jarring, but despite that I still found myself emotionally connecting with these characters. There was also an issue with how jarring some of the transitions were between scenes and the shift in tone. Some parts of the plot were not fully explained/developed. I think a majority of the critics of this movie are forgetting that it is meant for kids, and are upset that it is not a carbon copy of the original.

While the movie is not perfect, I would recommend seeing this movie if you like musicals or have kids. Just don't expect it to be as good as the original if Snow White is one of your favorites.",8/10
"Hearing all the reviews didn't help me go in with a positive or neutral mindset when watching this movie but I tried. The worst things I hate about this movie are that despite having a good buget this movie looks cheap, especially since it includes a lot of cgi in it. I also dont think they should have included that many songs or make the evil queen sing in the first place as it lessened her intimidation in the movie. Rachel Zegler really tries to carry the movie and there is no doubt that she can sing, but still the movie is all over the place and it doesnt feel as magical that you get lost in it, instead sometimes you trying to process all the things happening and you cant make up your mind if its bad or not, hopefully they can learn some things after this one.",6/10
"We don't have a TV or iPads at home, so when we go to the cinema, it's an event. A treat. A moment to savor. But halfway through this film, my kids turned to me and asked to leave. Not to go to the bathroom. Not because they were tired. But because they wanted to go home.

That alone says everything.

I didn't enjoy it either, but let's be honest-my opinion doesn't matter. It's a kids' movie, after all. Yet somehow, the very audience it was made for-the wide-eyed, story-loving children-sat there, unmoved. Uninterested. Unenchanted.

And as we walked out of that theater, my kids didn't ask what happened next. They didn't ask about the ending. They didn't ask for popcorn on the way home.

They just wanted to forget.",1/10
"I wanted to like this movie, but everything about this movie is horrendous. The CGI, stiff acting, and the disrespect against the original. Especially Gal Gadot's acting was horrible. She wasn't intimidating or charismatic. Zegler was also not good in this movie. Not even her singing skills could salvage the movie. I don't know how did they come up with the idea of remaking the beautiful into something so bland, boring and pointless. If you're gonna make a ""princess"" movie by changing everything about the princess, then change the movie title. I'm gonna watch the original again just to clean my eyes.",1/10
"Disney falls victim to the utterly unnecessary, out of proportion and non-sensical interpretation of a classic fairy tale. If you want to introduce modern day themes, could you please come up with fairy tales of your own instead of changing so much the original story that it loses any authenticity and becomes simply incredulous? Disney had previously no issues with inventing new characters with their very own storylines and frankly speaking this is how you adequately address relevant modern day themes and remain relevant. Otherwise the whole endeavour falls short of authenticity.

Rachel Zegler is super talanted and initially seemed a nice fit but her attitude to the criticism reflects poorely on her performance. Now, when you watch her on screen you don't see Snow White, all you can think of is her reaction to the critiicism. That makes her actually out of character here.",1/10
"Wow... this movie was bad. I went in hoping for at least something enjoyable, but honestly, it was just a mess from start to finish. The story felt weirdly disjointed, the CGI was awful, and the characters had zero chemistry. It didn't even feel like Snow White-more like a cheap knockoff trying way too hard to be modern.

The only thing that wasn't completely terrible? Rachel Zegler's singing. I'll give her that-she has a great voice, and it was literally the only thing keeping me from completely zoning out. But even that couldn't save this train wreck of a movie.

My girlfriend hated it too, which says a lot because she's usually way more forgiving about movies than I am. We both walked out wondering why Disney even bothered making this. Definitely a 1-star experience, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1/10
"Keep a wide berth. No way this movie was worth $18 in tickets and $40 in snacks. The showing I went to had like 5 people including me and my kid. Acting was wooden, there are a million other actors they could've chosen and they picked an actress who actively tried to inadvertently sabotage the movie. Gal Gadot was great, only redeeming part of the movie. I thought for a live action movie they'd actually have little people. They spent too much on visuals and not enough on the script. And wat was up with the dance number at the end with everyone in white? Looked like a Klan rally, just missing the funny hats. Anyways, save your money and pass this movie by.",1/10
"I should have stayed home and watched paint dry. This movie is a complete and utter disaster. Disney should be ashamed of themselves for making a remake and using Rachel as Snow white. She's talentless. I want my money back! The soposably remake wasn't even close to the original. Why do people say Rachel could sing so well? I didn't think so, and I wish I could have fast forwarded the parts where she sang. What a waste of my time and I feel bad for my boyfriend who load for us to see this movie. A total waste of my time and energy. Don't bother, watch it for free on Disney plus I'm sure theaters will removing it swiftly and it will be in Disney plus by Easter.",1/10
"First, let me quote Ansu Kabia's review: >That the audience for **Ari Aster**'s folk horror might find more pleasure in this Snow White than the average child is telling, since it's almost impossible to work out who this version of the story is aimed at. Children will be bored, teens talked down to, and most adults will wonder where their Snow White is.

Exactly. Who is the target audience of this movie, I couldn't discern. Perhaps the so-called theatre kids, but definitely not kids or adults. Here's my full review: * First, ***SUBSTANCE***: The tale of** Snow White** is inherently flawed and lacks substance, and despite going rebellious this version couldn't circumvent those weaknesses let alone translating them for better. Worsening on the other hand, well... * Now, ***VISUALS***? Too vibrant and glistening. The CGI is the biggest enemy in here because it's not disguised properly, and I'm not even going to talk about the catastrophe, that is the thing that happened with little people. The forest, animals, all those wooden houses, kingdom, grass, trees, plant - they are cartoonish, imagine how the special effects looked during ***Lord of the Rings***' era and then increase the saturation and contrast - that bad. It's flabbergasting that they did not go with the darker visuals as seen in the **1937 version** where no flamboyant yellow and green was needed. I take it they wanted to push some kind of ""joy"" based agenda here... I don't know. But the effects don't even match ***Beauty and the Beast*** and that thing came out 8 yrs ago. Maybe, Disney really isn't lying about the budget; maybe the budget really is under $300 million.

* Next ***ACTING***: **Rachel Zegler** can sing alright, and that's the only thing I can find positive to say about her. She's clearly s theater actress and the melodrama shows and gets annoying. That hairstyle isn't helping, and of course, the dress of Snow White makes her appear worse somehow. It's inexplicable, yet conspicuous. **Gal Gadot**, on the other hand, is really not given adequate character. She's an average actress, something we have known all along, but this appearance in here was laughably bad.

* Finally, ***STORY & DIRECTION***: The sloppy themes of leadership are laughable and you can clearly see **Greta Gerwig**'s work there, who was later replaced. Like ***Barbie***, this film go to extreme lengths to reiterate that ***Snow White*** would be a better leader, like Barbies and women in *Barbie*, but like that film it never corroborates that fact by answering ""why would that be?"" We have seen grittier version in ***Snow White and the Huntsman***, and honestly even that was not this bad. The problem is again these visuals and all the musical numbers really not helping.

Lastly, a note to director **Marc Webb**: i love your work in '***The Amazing Spider-Man***' franchise and I loved '***500 Days of Summer***' and I appreciated '***Gifted***,' but you need to stay away from reboots. People weren't happy with *TASM* coming out even though it was a brilliantly darker retelling, but '***Snow White***' just isn't it.

Of course, what's done is done, but let's not remake '***Kimi no Na Wa***.' okay, that thing is too knew for remakes, anyways, and Hollywood's butchery will not sit well there. If you thought this so-called ""right-wing"" backlash was bad, you ain't seen anime fans' fury yet.

So yeah, ***Snow White*** = not worth a watch, hype, or budget; hate and boycott on the other hand... Not sure it's for kids, definitely not for adults.",1/10
"CGI Dwarfs: A Paradox of Technical Showmanship and Emotional Disconnect The film replaces the iconic seven dwarfs with cartoonish CGI-generated figures, a decision widely condemned as a ""grotesque patchwork of cultural industry clichés"" .Worse, the dwarfs' design-trapped in an unsettling ""human-but-not-human"" limbo-erases the endearing whimsy of their animated counterparts. Over-reliance on flashy effects (e.g., ""magic-hour lighting"") further cheapens their presence, rendering them visually artificial. This obsession with technology reflects Disney's fundamental misunderstanding: the dwarfs are not mere fairy-tale tropes but vessels of humanized emotion. CGI's overuse strips them of this vital connection.

Snow White's flaws reflect Disney's recurring sins in live-action remakes: prioritizing technological spectacle and forced modern messaging over storytelling. When the magic mirror struggles to name ""the fairest,"" Disney should ask itself: true magic lies not in CGI dazzle but in reigniting the pure emotional resonance of fairy tales. Regrettably, this time, the bitterness of the poisoned apple overshadowed the princess's song.",1/10
"My 3 year old daughter is obsessed with Snow White. She loved it! We were both captivated throughout the film. The music, dancing and energy was great! I loved the additions to the storyline. It helps make more sense to the story. Every time I watch the original Snow White I fall asleep. I don't think I could ever fall asleep to this film. I went in expecting a bad movie but was pleasantly surprised how it turned out! I took 2 points off because the special effects and CGI was really bad on the dwarves. I think it would be more believable having real people play the parts with makeup. Also, the evil queen becoming the old lady really didn't need to be CGI. Where is the creativity in makeup? That was disappointing.",8/10
"Don't let all these critiques dissuade you, this is a perfectly fine Disney film and it's fun to watch. The film had good singalong scenes, beautiful costumes, decent animation (what is normally expected for these types of films), and a few nods to the original. The actors all did a good job at singing and dancing, and whilst Gal's voice is questionable, it fits the brief. Some of the scenes were a little on the cringe side (think High School Musical where singing and dancing scenes break out of nowhere), but it is fitting for this type of film. I would recommend watching the film with your kids or significant other.",6/10
"This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It looks cheap and rushed, feeling like it came out to cash in on the recent musical trend. But here's the thing when making the musical, the actors must sing well AND act well. There is maybe 1 song that was preformed tolerably out of all of them.

Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen was very painful to watch as she displays 0 acting or singing talent while having a sizeable time on screen. She's seriously the most devoid of emotion actress I've ever seen. Every single time. She's has a serious problem a lot of Model/Actresses have of trying to look good while acting at the same time.

Acting aside the movie on it's own feels extremely unfocused and scattered. It doesn't stick to one lane and it doesn't really know what it wants to be.

Save your theater money for something else.",1/10

"The heart of any Snow White adaptation is, of course, Snow White herself. In the original animated film, she was kind, optimistic, and full of warmth, making it easy to root for her. In this new version, however, Snow White is completely stripped of her innocence and replaced with an unlikeable, self-righteous protagonist who lacks any real character development. Instead of embodying the classic fairytale princess that audiences have loved for generations, this version of Snow White is written to be a modern, independent heroine-but it's done so clumsily that she comes off as arrogant rather than inspiring.

Her journey feels forced rather than organic, and the film goes out of its way to dismantle her traditional story without offering anything compelling in return. The result is a protagonist who is neither engaging nor sympathetic, making it difficult for audiences to feel invested in her fate.",1/10
"I was highly disappointed with the casting choices in the recent Snow White adaptation. The characters were miscast to the point where it felt like no thought was given to how well the actors suited their roles. Snow White, in particular, was not at all what I expected-her portrayal lacked the charm and innocence that the character traditionally embodies. The Dwarfs were another letdown, with each actor seeming out of place and struggling to bring the magic to life. Overall, the casting completely failed to capture the essence of this beloved classic, and it detracted from the entire experience. It felt like they prioritized star power over genuine talent and character consistency.",1/10
"The new Snow White movie was a massive disappointment. Despite its modern take on the classic, it fails to capture the charm or depth of the original. The plot feels disjointed, and the characters lack any real development. Snow White herself, while played by a talented actress, feels flat and uninspiring, not conveying the magic or innocence we loved in the animated version. The pacingno is off, and many of the new additions seem forced and unnecessary. The CGI is overdone, making the film feel artificial. Overall, it was a forgettable experience, and I wouldn't watch it again, no matter the incentive.",1/10
"I always try to keep an open mind when a movie gets negative buzz, giving it a fair chance to prove the critics wrong. But honestly, I can't wrap my head around how so much money and effort went into something that turned out this disappointing.

The end result is just frustrating-everything feels so artificial. The sets, the animals, and especially the Dwarves I don't even know what to say about them.

The biggest letdown? I wasn't expecting this, but without a doubt, the weakest link is Gal Gadot. She looks amazing, but her performance? Let's just say it won't be winning any awards for the right reasons.

What really surprised me was how bad the costumes looked on screen. Snow White's outfit just doesn't work, and that hairstyle what were they thinking?",1/10
"How do you manage to do bad writing on a story already written?...well, this movie is the answer. Fallen apart almost completely from the original Disney classic, instead of giving us something fresh and enjoyable, this version falls shorter next to many others already delivered by other producers, the movie feels joyless and hollow in a way that makes it uncomfortable to watch. The acting is another wedge of the sour apple, something you could called ""kids playing play pretend"" a protagonist that fails to connect and an (i must say) the worst representation of The Evil Queen ever seen

P. D: Something positive?

Dopey is kinda sweet.",1/10
"Snow White and the Seven Excuses feels less like a movie and more like Disney's hostage video to keep their IP rights. The lead actress delivers her role with the warmth of a tax audit, while the script trades magic for a moral lecture no one asked for. It's not a reimagining - it's a full-blown identity crisis wrapped in corporate virtue-signaling. The original gave us ""Whistle While You Work."" This one gives us ""Suffer While You Watch."" If Disney's goal was to make us root for the Evil Queen, mission accomplished. It's less ""happily ever after"" and more ""please make it stop"" - though stopping would require Disney to admit failure, and we all know that's not happening.",1/10
"I am a diehard Snow White fan and I was SO nervous going into this movie. But I will tell you...I LOVED IT! Stays to the original story but adds some more story. I thought it was wonderful!

Put aside any feelings you having with the girl cast as Snow White, and give it a shot. I thought she was great, beautiful voice, and Gal killed it! The dwarves were so cute and I loved the detail to things that were true to the original.

I really loved how they gave a little of Snow White's backstory and I loved how they did more with some of the dwarfs. There are added characters, but again...it fit right in.",8/10
"This was similar in feeling to the live action The Little Mermaid to me. Would have benefited from being a limited tv series. Seems a lot could have been developed more, especially the ending. It would have been nice for them to expand on ideas more. Like Jonathan's group or more shown on the dwarves or snow whites relationship with the queen. It seemed like they tried to cram too much in for a movie.

Overall not bad and the acting was okay. I'm a fan of musicals, so did enjoy the numerous songs. The costumes could have been better, though I see where they were going with snow white and the evil queens dresses. Her red dress reminded me of belles blue dress in the live action.

The ending felt a bit weak and I feel certain parts needed more depth or explanation than was given. My 13yo was skeptical based on the online comments but she liked it well enough, but didn't love it.",6/10
"Disney's Snow White remake is yet another reminder that just because you can remake a classic doesn't mean you should. Instead of breathing new life into the beloved tale, this version drowns in excessive CGI, uninspired storytelling, and the baffling decision to replace the iconic dwarfs with unsettling digital creations that look like they wandered out of a discount fantasy game.

Rachel Zegler tries her best, but even she can't save this snoozefest. And Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen? Let's just say she brings all the menace of a mildly irritated fashion model. The film does have some nice backgrounds-so if you're into staring at pretty scenery while your soul slowly leaves your body, this might be for you.

At this point, Disney's remakes feel less like creative projects and more like a dare to see how much audiences will tolerate. Please, for the love of all things animated, stop giving these cash grabs your money.",1/10
"Awful movie, wouldn't take kids to see it the CGI dwarves are almost scary! Just do yourself a favor and stay away from this steaming pile pinched out by Disney! Story deviates from the original and adds nothing, the only real plus side of this movie is the Lead actress can actually sing pretty well. Overall though a solid 1/10 just leave it for a TV showing 5 years from now. Gal Gadot phoned this one in to boot and nobody else seems to have acting chops worth a darn even Snow White herself gets fairly annoying when she isn't singing. The bandits are just completely irrelevant and the story could happen without them. This is just a disjointed mess.",1/10
"I've endured cinematic war crimes, every Sharknado nightmare, the first episode of She-Hulk, but nothing prepared me for this. This wasn't just bad; it was a mind-rotting, soul-crushing descent into cinematic hell. Every second felt like psychological torture, each line of dialogue a dagger to my sanity. The acting was an insult to human intelligence, the script a war crime against storytelling. After 30 minutes, I had two choices: walk out or gouge my eyes out with rusty spoons. I escaped, but the trauma lingers, haunting me like a curse I'll never escape. Don't suffer like me, avoid this travesty.",1/10

She does not need anyone because she is a strong independent woman! Also, why she ordered the whatever creature to do the cleaning? She supposes to be a teamwork or a show of kindness? What is this all about? From the beginning till the end, the plot didn't change and became too much predictable!",1/10
"This version of Snow White is an utter disappointment. What was once a magical and heartwarming fairy tale has been reduced to a lifeless, soulless mess. The characters feel super flat, the story drags, and any attempt at modernizing the plot just ends up feeling forced and awkward. The visuals are uninspired, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the charm of the original is completely gone. Even the iconic moments fail to land. It's hard to believe how much potential was wasted here. I expected nostalgia and wonder - instead, I got boredom and frustration. One star, and even that feels generous.",1/10

"This film is another chapter in Disney attempting to ruin their entire back catalog. Perhaps in another 10-20 years, they can get around to ruining what few decent things they've made this decade. It is utterly disgusting they could stoop to these lows. This is a company who easily made modern classics just 30 years ago and now can only make terrible and offensive remakes of classics that never needed any kind of remake to begin with. This most recent attempt at murdering their classics is particularly soulless, vapid and made by people who clearly hate the original film and the Grimm take. So why didn't they just make their own new movie?",1/10

"Aside from Gal Gadots cardboard acting and a weak third act, the film was entertaining. The sets were colorful, the dwarfs were super fun to watch, the songs are catchy and memorable, Zeglers singing is incredible, and it's pretty faithful to the source material aside from some slight changes to stretch the run time.

I've seen all the disney live actions thus far and this is easily one of the top 3 best ones (which isn't saying much, but still...). I'm really surprised the movies getting this much hate. I thought Moana 2 was SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Snow White in nearly every aspect, and that movie got nominated for a golden globe, haha. So somethings definitely off with people when it comes to this movie, not sure what.",6/10
"This thing is a glittering dumpster fire - so much money, so much time, and the final product feels like it was filmed inside a Spirit Halloween store two days before closing. I was ready to give it a fair shot, but by the end, I was clutching my popcorn in a desperate attempt to find something to give me joy.

Dear Disney, blink twice if you need help. Because whatever spell you were under while making this - it backfired.

And let's be real - this isn't just a Snow White problem. Disney has been slowly losing its magic over the past five years like a wizard who dropped his wand in a sewer. Not every movie has been a disaster, sure, but the ratio of hits to head-scratchers is starting to look like a losing bingo card.

They've traded heart, soul, and storytelling for glossy visuals, weird remakes no one asked for, and scripts that feel like they were written by an AI fed nothing but inspirational Instagram quotes and corporate synergy meetings.

Remember when Disney used to make you feel something?",1/10
"It's not even worth expending energy to review this garbage. Disney, Rachel Zegler, and Kathleen Kennedy are uncreative, narrow minded, myopic destroyers of good ideas.

The story is ruined in this version. It isn't even true to the original idea-I'd be insulted if I were the author. I'd also be insulted if I had dwarfism, because this story is renowned for its positive roles for actors of smaller stature. And yet...they aren't part of this production. Pathetic!

Disney will grow and innovate again in the future if it's smart, and purges the poison apples from the hallways, stages, offices, and conference rooms of its storied enterprise. Until then, don't reward them with your cash and attention.

"There is no meaningful coherence in the production-performances are strange and erratic, without any apparent purpose. The direction seems nonexistent in absolutely every aspect. There was no genuine attempt to make this work even remotely digestible.

The attempt to turn the story into some kind of evolutionary turning point failed miserably.

Comparing the production, acting, and script to any Golden Raspberry Award-winning film is inevitable (the ""winners"" of those are probably 100 times better). I've seen better stories on television during 30-second commercials for products I had no interest in buying.

I tried to give the production a real chance, hoping the criticism was just nitpicking. But honestly... I couldn't make it to the end. This might be the worst film I've ever seen in my life.",1/10
"Dont watch it it is a waste of time and money. She has a good voice but she is not snow white. Its nothing compared to the original. The dwarves are odd, the original Snow white is humble, sweet, loving, adventurous & courageous. This snow white is fake & literally horrible. Nothing compared to the original.

Unbelievably disappointing.

There is no emotional touch, No attention to detail, no chemistry between the Prince & Princess. Gal gadot looks good but her acting doesn't suit the drama.

Seriously disappointing and this will be a huge loss for Disney. I dont understand why they are ruining classics. I dont know how they could go wrong with a remake. The story is well known. Unbelievable !!",1/10
"Very disappointing, nothing like the og film.

Did not like the choice of actors, cgi was off.

They should've just left the og movie be, and remade into this disaster.

Took my 6 year old and 8 year old to watch, they did not like the film either, the beauty and magic was lacking to say the least.

Lead actor was not ""the fairest and beautiful"" she did sing very well but could not get over the fact that the evil witch envied her looks lol The cgi dwarves and animals were off as well, we're in 2025 - I expected better. I would definitely not rewatch this, regret watching to begin with.

"I just watched the movie, and wow, I absolutely loved it. Maybe even the best live-action Disney film ever. It captured something truly magical-the kind of wonder and heart that made the original so special, while adding its own unique charm. The visuals were stunning, the performances were heartfelt, and the music was absolutely enchanting.

What frustrates me the most is that this film was torn apart before it even had a chance! People judged it before seeing it, without giving it the opportunity to shine. But it does shine-brightly! It's a film full of joy, adventure, and pure Disney magic.

This is a movie I wholeheartedly wish upon the world, and I hope that one day it will find a well-deserved place on Broadway. It has everything a great musical needs-memorable songs, lovable characters, and a story that touches the heart. The stage would be the perfect home for this incredible tale.

And let's talk about Dopey-he is, without a doubt, the star of the show! His charm, humor, and warmth stole every scene, and I couldn't help but fall in love with his character all over again.

If you're on the fence about watching this film, I urge you to give it a chance. It deserves to be seen, to be celebrated, and to be remembered as the magical experience that it is.",10/10
"This refreshed live action version of Snow White still brings in the nostalgia of some the songs and characters we remember from the animated film but modernizes it. While the movie has a bit more adventure it still holds it charm and adorable characters, just like the classic you remember!

The film does a good job of explaining the relationship between the evil Queen and Snow White. As simply touched in the original film, more time is spent on backstory of what happened to Cinderella's parents and the Queen's ability to put up with Snow White...well, until she doesn't.

A reimagining Seven Dwarfs and Snow White's love interest is refreshing. Oh, they even remembered to incorporate Snow White's loving forrest animals who are by her side, just like in the original. What is a nice bonus is they added some action/adventure in the film while empowering Snow White. No longer is Snow White just the victim or a character that needs saving, Snow White becomes the hero of her own story (with the help of others). This new twist is a good way to empower younger audiences while still letting Snow White choose good to conquer evil.

Go into the theater expecting a good story. Do not try to compare the film too much to the original and you will have fun. Snow White may have gotten a make-over in terms of additions and presentations but there is still enough from the original that you will recognize.",6/10
"Hands down the worst remake Disney has ever made, and possibly the worst remake of all time. Just CGI slop, horrendous, laughable ""acting"" and the singing is atrocious.

It is insane to think anyone wanted to green light this project, like they purposefully wanted to ruin as many people's childhood memories as possible, and on top of that the controversy surrounding Rachel Zegler does not help this movie whatsoever.

Do yourself a favor and just don't. There are many better movies to see, even if you're going for the kids. Even my daughter didn't like it. She said it was hard for her to even pay attention because of how boring it was.

"This movie is god awful.

2025 live-action remake of ""Snow White"" is a disheartening misstep that fails to capture the essence of the original classic. The film's attempt to modernize the narrative results in a convoluted plot that lacks the charm and coherence of its predecessor.

Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White is uninspiring, rendering the character as a bland and unremarkable figure. Her performance lacks the depth and warmth needed to engage the audience, making it difficult to empathize with her journey. Gal Gadot's role as the Evil Queen is equally disappointing; her portrayal lacks the menace and complexity that made the original character so iconic. Gadot's performance comes across as superficial, failing to evoke any genuine sense of threat or intrigue.",1/10
While I understand the vision of the movie it wasn't a great selection. I feel like the witch would have been better cast as Snow White. CGI dwarves is a joke. The looked awful. I feel like there was great effort but little delivery. The dwarves didn't get much attention. This may be best for strictly children and not those who grew up loving the original. Snow White I feel like was a strong miscast.

Not being faithful to the original cartoon is fine, but forcing in girl power message make this version of Snow White unwatchable. The storyline is ridiculous, scenes like making apple pie for the poor are just making me puke. When people are poor, feed them with the most basic food so that you can help the most people, not go to make apple pie.

The only good part about this movie is that I can watch it in an empty cinema, peaceful.",1/10

The kids in the movie theater i saw it at reacted to alot of parts you would expect children to react to. Ultimately if the movie needs saving and Disney needs A WIN, crossover movie will have to be done, OR Kingdom hearts. I would see this movie on a Tuesday if in a date or weekend midday if you don't expect your kids to be quite. There lots of singing. Gal does a great job at bringing evil to the forefront with a spicy aura. The CG dwarves were kinda over the top and hard to look at but they were very high quality. Maybe they could have made them more important or explained why they mine and built SNOW WHITE AN ACTUAL SLEEPING CHAMBER.",6/10
"This movie is a perfect example of how not to remake a classic. The film strips away everything that made the original special its charm, heart, and magic, replacing it with a dull, soulless attempt at modernization.

"The remake of such an iconic movie should have been done with more accuracy. The movie was dry and dull at moments. The dwarves were grumpy and unlike the original dwarves. The story was changed to meet with more modern times which made the movie awkward and hard to enjoy by adults and children who are accustom to the original adaptation.

The writers should had stayed accurate and true to the original movie. This movie was forced to meet with modern times which didn't cross over so well.

"Oh, the new Snow White movie-what a cinematic triumph! It's like they took the original and thought, ""How can we make this worse?"" The answer: mission accomplished.

The visual effects are stunningly mediocre, a true homage to the early days of CGI when everyone looked like they'd been sculpted from plasticine. The acting? Let's just say the trees in the forest had more charisma.

And the plot twists! Who knew you could stretch a fairy tale into a convoluted mess that leaves you longing for a good old-fashioned nap? The dialogue is a masterpiece of banality, perfect for anyone who enjoys conversations as riveting as paint drying.

The real gem, though, is the soundtrack. Each song is a delightful reminder of how much you miss the originals, delivered with the enthusiasm of someone forced to sing at gunpoint.

In summary, if you love watching your childhood favorites butchered beyond recognition, this movie is your dream come true. Enjoy the train wreck!",1/10
"Avoid this at all costs. It's an absolute mess-poorly written, lazily directed, and filled with lifeless performances. The actors seem uninterested, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the overall execution is embarrassingly bad. It's astonishing that Disney, with all its resources, produced something this terrible. Every scene feels forced, lacking heart or creativity, and the pacing drags unbearably. The visuals aren't even impressive enough to distract from the terrible storytelling. This deserves to fade into obscurity, never to be spoken of again. Save yourself the time and frustration-skip it and watch something actually worth your attention. You'll thank me later.",1/10

Snow White (2025) is a baffling attempt at ""reimagining"" a beloved classic that completely misses the mark.

I am glad it failed but not because of the actress. I feel that the movie looked atrocious. Compared to ALL movies I. The past I think the costumes look horrendous. I mean even the one above the guy looks like he's wearing some post apocalyptic hoodie not clothes from the time period. The dress looks horrible.

"Sometimes the fairest of them all is the one that challenges your comfort zone.

I have never gone to see a film purely because of how much backlash it was receiving, but-well-there is a first time for everything. The controversy around Disney's live-action Snow White intrigued me. The outrage, the think pieces, the online vitriol-it all made me wonder what, exactly, people were so furious about.

So I went in with no expectations. No nostalgia bias. No need to defend the original. And I was absolutely blown away.

Let me say this plainly: there is nothing wrong with this film. Nothing. If its message-of strength, compassion, justice, and self-determination-bothers you, then the problem is not with Snow White. The problem is you.

Imagine being upset about a story where a young woman rises to face evil, saves her kingdom, refuses to be passive, finds love without surrendering her independence, and dares to do what is right even when it is dangerous. That is the story this film tells, and it tells it with heart, humor, and visual beauty.

The performances are vibrant, the sets and costumes are lush and imaginative, and the direction is sure-handed. There is joy in this film. A sense of play. A deliberate balance between honoring the classic tale and reinterpreting it for a generation that sees the world through a more inclusive and complex lens.

Were there things that could have been done differently? Certainly. No film is perfect. But the core of this one-its spirit, its message, its visual and emotional execution-is solid. More than solid. It is delightful.

Would I take children to see this? Absolutely. Not only would I take them, I would encourage them to watch the original animated Snow White first and then experience this new version. Let them see how stories evolve over time. Let them see that heroines can grow stronger, villains more nuanced, and messages more resonant.

And if it bothers you that Snow White is not the same as she was in 1937... well, I do not know what to tell you.

Maybe... grow up?",9/10
"The movie was fine. My 6 and 7 year olds were happy. I watched it all. Didn't mind taking my youngest to the bathroom, 😉, when that time came.

This movie is not the end of the world. If your kid wants to see it, take them. It's something to do.

Having said that, I paid $5 each at a local antique theatre where the small popcorn is $1.50. If I'd paid $15 a head, I would still be happy cause my girls liked if but it wouldn't have been worth all that... as a paying parent.

Use this as you will. Hope my words help the boiling controversy. It could have been better, but I'm not big on musicals anyway. The Snow White sang well enough Gal Gadough (sp) was underwhelming and proved to be a bit of a drag to the plot line. Just wasn't able to hate her enough. She wasn't a good villain.

It was so different and changed that if you put in different characters, no one would notice it was supposed to be a Snow White retelling.

"Disney's live-action Snow White is a disastrous misstep, failing on nearly every front. The film's attempt to modernize the classic story results in a muddled and uninspired narrative, with changes that feel forced rather than meaningful. Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the charm and warmth of the original, while Gal Gadot's Evil Queen delivers an underwhelming and wooden performance.

Visually, the film is equally disappointing. The CGI dwarfs are unsettling, the overuse of digital effects makes everything feel artificial, and the production design lacks the magical quality that made the animated version timeless. The musical numbers, including the new songs, are forgettable and lifeless, failing to capture the spirit of the original score.

Ultimately, Snow White is another unfortunate example of Disney's inability to recapture the magic of its animated classics. It strips away the charm and heart of the original in favor of uninspired storytelling and lackluster execution. A major disappointment .",1/10
"This movie looks haphazardly thrown together, almost as though they tried to mash three different films shot in three different ways together (which they probably did with all the reshoots). Not only does Zegler make her character insufferable to watch (as she did in the most recent hunger games movie, don't even get me started on thay abominable accent she used) the dwarves are terribly ugly and unnerving to watch. Making them CGI also took away work opportunities from 7 individuals. The plot and premise was not terrible itself. The execution and character selections were. So now we have another live action of Disney classic to add to the flaming, sinking ship that is the Disney company.

Opening day brought in a paltry $43-48 mil, nowhere close to breaking even with its $209 mil budget. While it did get closer to breaking even with a $100 mil for the entire weekend it remains to be seen if this movie will actually break even or take a loss.

terrible actors
ridiculous screenplay

Solidarity for Gal Gadot, a flower rising in the muck (even if her acting proof is forgettable).

Walt Disney is spinning so hard in his grave that he has become a nuclear turbine.",1/10
"Where to begin? The movie itself is not good. Plain and simple. The fact they strayed from the original material and fairytale is a different story. The CGI dwarves are not good, the change of Snow Whites archetype and character (to now being at ambitious leader who doesn't really need a 'Prince'?), and overall tone/script is bad. Gal Gadot, beautiful, should not have been cast in her role, it's bizarre! Her acting is just not good, sorry. New songs are trash. Not good. No magical element like the 1990s Disney Renaissance movies had with their soundtracks. The worst is the Snow White actress. In all seriousness, her acting is horrendous. I can't believe this is actually a movie.

Save your time, money, and energy and watch a different movie !",1/10
"This snow white movie is the worst thing i've ever spent money on. If i could go back in time the one thing i would do is unwatch this movie. I deserve a refund. The music was terrible, the acting was terrible, the script was terrible, and EVERYTHING was CGI. I'm not a rachel zegler hater but she suuucked in this. Also lowkey what's wrong with wanting a prince?? If she doesn't want him ill take him hello? Part of the princess movies is having a love interest, if we want to convey the idea that women don't need men then disney should make NEW stories where princesses don't have love interests. Why are we changing the OG?? Also snow white is originally soft spoken and quiet and rachel was like screaming the whole movie. It was so intense. Anyways don't waste ur time spend that money on something more important.",1/10
"It was very bad. I think the role of Snow White is black, but in the animated film Snow White is white. I don't want to talk about bias, but I think they made a lot of bad choices in choosing the characters for acting. In choosing the witch, Gal Gadot is very beautiful. I don't understand why they made her a witch. And for many other roles, the choice of actors was very bad. Very bad. I don't wish the movie any success because when you see the trailer, you will regret watching the whole movie. But I saw the movie because of Gal Gadot. I saw it only because of her. That's what I think if anyone reads my review, don't watch it because they will regret it, I promise you.",1/10
"Ugh, I hate this new version! Bring back the old one, the one we all loved! Get better actors who actually believe in love at first sight, we loved the original story. Bring back the writers who loved the old story, the ones we grew up with. Disney used to make everyone happy, what happened? Why's everything so complicated now? Just make a simple reboot with a cast that's closer to the original. Do you *have* to change the story? Make a new one and call it something else - for goodness sake, stop ruining our childhood! Stop trying to insert your own thinking in every story. I hope Disney do better in the future.",1/10
"Honestly, I wouldn't have given this any stars if I didn't have to. Gal Gadot's performance was beyond disappointing-her line delivery felt so forced, unnatural, and completely lacking in emotion. She didn't bring any depth or presence to the role, and it honestly made the entire thing hard to watch. Compared to Charlize Theron's version, which had power and nuance, Gal's version felt like a parody. It just didn't land at all. The only reason I'm giving this any stars is because of Rachel-her vocals were stunning, and her acting actually brought some life to the film. Gal ruined it for me. Major yikes.",1/10
"This movie was a complete waste of time. The acting was terrible. The dialogue felt forced, and the special effects were laughably bad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The pacing was incredibly slow, making it hard to stay engaged. The characters had no depth, and their decisions made no sense. Overall, it felt like a low-effort production that should have never been made. Even the soundtrack was dull and forgettable. It felt like the filmmakers didn't care about delivering a quality experience. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. Save yourself the disappointment and watch something else.",1/10
"I have done watching, i don't like it when she is acting like cleaning with an angry face and changing the real story. You said have traumatic with snow white so don't playing. I don't really get it Disney really, you know Disney has much hate for many reasons but i still watch they are movie and this really makes me hate you change many plot snow white. Especially the way she conveyed in the interview about snow white as a child is very confusing, if it's like that why did you accept this movie (don't say because of money) you can reject it. And Disney, gosh I don't know anymore, I don't know who's brain in your team to change this plot but what I know is that Walt Disney is crying up there, you are making Disney gradually collapse that makes people survive is because of Walt Disney's work not the work of his successors.",1/10
"Went in with absolutely zero expectations, left with a smile in my face. And.. Rachel carried the role well. She performed with so much honesty and sang like a bird. The only part that I couldnt really embrace was the CGI dwarves. But they too became endearing. Loved that they kept the classics in.. Hi Ho, Hi Ho.. loved the visuals.. just wished the stylist styled Rachel better..

So, what was right with it? ..well almost everything except Snow White's dress. It looked cheap.. like crepe material.. other than that the remodernised version is resonates with that of an empowered princess.. I just did not like Gal Gadit's potrayal.. she definitely isn't a singer..

But it was not bad at all.",10/10
"Snow White is another Disney feel-good movie, while the movie captures the essence of the original there are some things that could have been better.

Pros- The characters are portrayed very similar to the animated version. There are some good sing along songs throughout the movie. The selection of the cast is a good one and it works. It is nice to see Wonder Woman playing villain this time around.

Cons- Wardrobe/Costumes could have been better. CGI in some characters was not the best.

While this may not be the best Disney movie, it is definitely not the worse. Surprisingly the movie is enjoyable.",6/10
"I am just mad you can't put 0 out of 10 stars... come on IMDb!

From badly animated dwarves and not being able to connect to the bad performance of the main character is something that is constantly an issue throughout the movie.

Sadly the publicity surrounding the movie did not help it the least. You watch it and always has in back of your mind that the production and the actors and actresses all think it's a bad story with an outdated motive.

Please let's keep the classics and create new stories instead. You can make authentic stories based on whatever notion of correct values you may have.

But when you try to change iconic movies you just seem narrow and plain lazy.",1/10
"I went into the theater with high hopes, but by the end of this *Snow White*, I was ready to throw my apple at the screen. And not in a good way.

First off, Snow White's ""personality"" is so flat, it made me appreciate the charm of cardboard. She spends most of the movie looking like she just got out of bed... and that's not even the worst part. I'm pretty sure I saw more emotion in a rock. Maybe she was just saving her energy for the 27 minutes of forced empowerment speeches that made me wonder if I'd accidentally stumbled into a TED Talk.

As for the dwarfs-sorry, ""Magical Creatures of Incredibly Undistinguished Stature""-they seemed more interested in selling me insurance than helping Snow White. There was one who literally just grumbled, and I thought, ""Hey, at least he's relatable."" But then he started singing, and I realized I'd rather listen to a broken vacuum cleaner.

The evil queen? Let's just say I'd trust my personal data with her more than I'd trust her to steal a single apple. Her evil monologues were so dramatically awkward, I started looking for hidden cameras. The only thing scary about her was how much I kept checking my watch.

But the real kicker? The final battle. It was so anti-climactic, I almost thought I was watching a tutorial for how to ""defeat your enemies by accidentally tripping over your own cape.""

In conclusion, this movie is like a bad dream where everyone forgot their lines, and the only thing ""magical"" is how quickly I'll forget it. 1/5 stars. Would not recommend. Unless you want to see what happens when you give a classic fairy tale a gluten-free, soy-free, no-fun makeover.",1/10

"First let me say I had low expectations for this film and somehow it still disappointed even those. The acting and the effects were as bad as one has come to expect from Disney these days. The writing was all over the place like they took a bunch of different scripts and jammed them together with no rewrites to smooth it out. The music was not bad but I would also not call it Disney magic worthy either. It was as forgettable as the male side character. The dwarves were honestly kind of creepy, I expected them to be from what was shown in the trailer. But seeing them in the film was so much worse. This is honestly a movie that should be rebranded as a horror B list movie where it is watched ironically. And even with a big name of Gal Gadot playing the Evil Queen could not even carry the film. It honestly hindered it more then helped.

All in all a waste of my time and money.",2/10
"Yesterday, I went in thinking, 'People just want to hate on it so badly, but it's probably not that bad.' As a big fan of the original, I'd already accepted that the story would be changed. But honestly, what even was this?

It was very, very bad-my best friend and I almost walked out early. Rachel's acting felt so fake, like you could see she was trying too hard instead of making her emotions feel real. All of Gal Gadot's singing seemed completely out of character and awkward. It was a very bad movie; I strongly recommend you do not go watch this. Save your time and money! Skip it entirely.....",2/10
"I just finished watching the new Snow White movie, and unfortunately, it was a huge letdown. The story felt hollow and lacked the charm of the original. The acting was wooden, and the characters didn't feel believable or likable. The visuals and effects weren't enough to carry the film, and the changes to the classic tale didn't add anything meaningful-in fact, they took away from what made the story timeless. Overall, it felt like a soulless, poorly written remake. I wouldn't recommend it. It almost seems as though they should've exchanged roles Rachel Ziegler should've been the one playing the evil queen and Gal Gadot should've been Snow White.",2/10
"You know what's funny? A Minecraft Movie first teaser was hated so much, but then as time goes on and they release more finalized footages of the movie it got better review and overwhelmingly positive compare to the teaser. This movie since the very beginning from the announcement, teaser, trailer, and premiere doesn't get any better. Honestly what's even the point of remaking this anyway? If you want to remake it just reanimate it or something no need for all this CGI fake forest and dwarfs. Honestly this should be the final nail in the Coffin. No more live action remake, ts is one of if not the worst one. Gave 2 Stars to respect the animators for having to sit and Animate the dwarfs for probably A year.",2/10
"Disney have released (and I've watched) 2 Disney releases this year. I thought Lion King was brilliant, amazing CGI, good story and was engrossed the whole time.

Unfortunately Snow White tried to hard to be modern against a 1930s film. I felt Disney became obsessed about not offending people but ended up doing just that. The film didn't need to be this complicated. I suspect children might enjoy this (which is maybe Disneys aim) but adults I feel will see it as a failed attempt at telling us how we should think and what's right or wrong.

When CGI is done properly it looks great, but only the animals were needed for CGI in this film. The dwarfs (yes I'm calling those characters that!) could and should have been played by actors. The dwarfs reminded me of the elf's in Polar Express - creepy looking!",2/10
"I honestly do not get the bad press and hate for this film its was a great homage to the original, it was camp and fun and whimsical the musical numbers were funny and witty. I even thought the seven dwarfs were great and story gave the characters backstories & depth Dopey was a highlight! Also i think the way Rachel and Gal worded things to the press just rubbed people the wrong way but to be honest she was right it wasn't about Snow White falling for a prince or being helpless she grew as a woman and a Queen with the film i DO NOT understand people hate for this film. I think its more hate toward disney as a corporation then the actual film! Watch it and make your own minds up.",9/10
"Rachel's singing was EXCELLENT! Disneys ability to stay with the original story... ( well they changed it a lot ). ""Where the Good things Grow"", made me feel like, ehhh. Well... it didn't match this movie at all, or the theme. Evil queen roll? She is so so beautiful. HOWEVER, we all know she's a great actress, so if you talent is solid, then who's fault is it? Also that evil queen song was not the right song for her, or Disney for that matter. That song felt really off. There are a lot of moments the film doesn't connect. It's not one problem, or person. This was a freight train of politics. If you're a fan you may like it. But it's not the original at all. This is a totally fresh take. - let's talk about something really good though. The end of the film had a strong redeeming quality because of its message. That was in my opinion this film greatest asset.",6/10
"What has happened to Disney? This version of Snow White is soulless and lifeless. It's like 3 movie scripts were written and then cut together, none of which were good. The dwarfs look and sound horrible and don't get me started on the bandits. Whose idea was it to add those guys to the mix? Rachel L has a great voice but the songs she sings are dull. What a difference between the loving and caring depiction of the animated classic to this monstrosity. The normally reliable Gal Gadot phones in this performance. The shining star is probably the mirror on the wall. One of the worst movies I can remember.",2/10

"Rachel Zegler is one of the great up-and-coming (if not in some aspects ""already arrived"") song-and-dance-picture stars. Her casting as live-action Snow White is as savvy as Emma Watson's Belle in the similar Beauty and the Beast. Unfortunately, Zegler's talent and charm is about all Snow White has going for it, as it runs into all the same problems as so many of the Disney live-action remakes before it.

For a very basic overview, Snow White tells the iconic tale of the titular princess (Zegler) who is pursued by her evil Queen stepmother (Gal Gadot) and finds refuge both with the enigmatic Seven Dwarves and a rebel named Jonathan (Andrew Burnap).

Again: Zegler is a true standout here. The top moments of this movie are her reprising Whistle While You Work and contributing the original song Princess Problems. In those moments, one can understand why this project was greenlit-because they contain some charm.

Alas, Snow White suffers-like the long line of recent Disney animation remakes before it-from the ""why is this necessary?"" and the ""balance between new/old"" problems. The 1937 original ushered in Disney's reign of animation/musical dominance and this one obviously can't hold a candle to that in scope/spectre. So, director Marc Webb tries to infuse some new material-only to have it be an odd mix trying to weave it in with the classic bits.

Of course, Disney's own petty political panderings hurt this production too. Casting real actors as the Seven Dwarves would have made this a more fun/unique experience-but the Mouse House got rattled by a ridiculous ""dwarfism"" controversy and instead went with dwarf-animation. An asinine choice considering the '37 animation in that department is one of Disney's most iconic properties.

So, overall, I view 2025's Snow White as a great resume-builder for Rachel Zegler-and that's about it. This is a movie absolutely screaming to be liked (who doesn't enjoy a magical fairy tale?!) and only Zegler provides a few of those moments. But for the most part, it is uneven bits and bobs of old and new beats stitched together in Frankenstein-fashion.",4/10

"So boring. Honestly, I really wanted to like Snow White, but I found it kind of boring. The story just dragged for me, and I kept checking the time to see how much was left. I get that it's a classic, and the shots were good, but the pacing felt super slow, and the characters didn't really pull me in. I know it's meant to be a fairy tale, but compared to more modern movies, it just didn't hold my attention. Maybe it's more enjoyable for kids or hardcore Disney fans, but it just wasn't for me. My kids fell asleep and they were begging to leave early. I want to watch it again though maybe I missed something.",1/10
"Bad remake of such a great story. Acting was bland and boring and the story was subpar. I honestly didn't think it would be as bad as people were saying but boy was I wrong. There was a lot of horrible publicity surrounding this movie and the actor in it, I wish I could say that was the reason for the bad reviews everywhere but it's not. Everyone who was in the theater with me agreed that the movie was just a steaming pile of garbage. Disney really dropped the ball with this one and it really is a shame because my family and I were looking forward to this movie for quite some time. Hopefully Disney steps it up for their next take on a classic and uses this movie as a blueprint for what not to do.",1/10
"They make it looks like its an emancipation film, but then when the old king died and ""The Evil Queen"" rose, everything then went to turmoil real fast, make it make sense, and the musical? Cringe, Cringe. Weird, weird (even worse than Cats) the cast looks like prisoner of the script, some of the actor looks like they dont belong, and a realy weird movie and such a weird title to be remake into live action, the CGI is realy bad and i just dont get why people watch, is it because of nostalgia? Is it because of the cast? What is exactly it? I dont realy think disney think this one through and just let everyone burn money, yeah i guess every kingdom can fall eeh?",1/10
"This movie was entertaining and while some of the CGI was bad, a lot of it was awesome! The dwarves were a little off for me but the witch transitions were great! My teen sons liked it and they are very critical so I'm happy it was entertaining and fun to compare the original animated movie with them. I wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised to be smiling and laughing at different times. The songs were cute and the symbolism was great. See it with your kids and loved ones and enjoy a night out. Costumes were great too! It's shocking to see such low numbers for this movie but to each their own. If you want a cute movie for the family, go see Snow White! Form your own opinion!",9/10
"3 out of 5 stars.

Snow White is a fair fantasy musical film based on the original animated film. There is some changes but the magic is missing in this one.

Pros: The plot is good. It's somewhat similar to the original with substituting Prince Charming for Jonathan. Which seemed a bit dull as a character.

Rachel Zegler did great as the role. Her performance and talent is growing and sweet. Gal Gadot as the evil queen was great.

The musical sequences are great. It does hit the high notes with a lot of heart.

Cons

The script felt a little underdeveloped with the characters. Jonathan who is supposed to be Snow Whites love interest was underdeveloped. Making his character dull. The evil queen another underdeveloped character that wastes the talent of Gal Gadot.

The visual effects were a bit of a miss. The dwarves looked like unfinished cgi work. Which was a sad thing. Cause those characters were supposed to be the lovable part of the film. And yet this film makes them forgettable.

Overall, it is an okay film with a great cast but the script is undeveloped in some areas making a lot of characters forgettable. And the visuals were a bit uneven. The musical sequences and casts were great with plenty of entertainment.",6/10
"In Snow White, the contrast between the performances of the main villain and the protagonist is striking. The Evil Queen's portrayal comes off as overly dramatic and lacks the nuance that could have made her a more compelling character. The acting feels forced, monotoned, and the villain often comes across as one-dimensional seemingly from acting alone lol which detracts from the overall tension and engagement of the story.

On the other hand, Snow White herself delivers a commendable performance. Zegler brings warmth and charm to the character, effectively embodying the innocence and kindness that define her. However, despite her strong acting, the script fails to provide her with meaningful dialogue or character development. This mismatch leaves her character feeling underwritten and limits the potential impact of her performance. Overall, while the protagonist shines through her acting, it's unfortunate that the script doesn't do justice to her talent.",1/10

"I really thought, If Gal Gadot is in the movie, it should be a good movie.....WRONG! Super boring, insipid story, nothing exciting, nothing new, nothing creative, they filled the emty spaces with a lot of songs that do not have much to do with the movie, there are scenes that have a lack of extras or actors (maybe they got bored too and went to their own houses), it have some special effects but nothing out of the ordinary at all, so little happened on the movie that for time to time i thought that it was made entirely with IA in stead of writters. My 7 year old fell sleep, my 14yo left the theater.",1/10
"In my opinion this movie was lacking the magic and passion characteristic of Disney. The dwarves are too strange looking. The scenery was too cliche and lacked originality.

As for the performances, they were nothing to write home about. The cast seemed uninspired, with no real chemistry or emotional depth. It was hard to feel invested in their journeys, and I found myself checking my watch more than once.

Overall, Snow White 2025 feels like a hollow reimagining that didn't capture the magic of the original. The movie had the potential to be something special, but instead, it just left me disappointed and bored. Definitely not worth the watch.",1/10
"This is by far one of the most mind numbing things I saw at a theater in a long time. This feels like one of those cash grabs that Disney made so they can pray that their company will actually succeed. The dialogue was dull the story was boring and had the most basic plot I have ever witnessed for a movie. This isn't really a surprise to me but it happened to be a musical. And they also happened to sing every 5 minutes! I think they should have just called the movie ""Snow white the musical"". Another side note is the fact that the dwarfs looked like they were on steroids or something💀 although it sucked it wasn't as bad as the newer princess movies Disney has made.",2/10
"Disney failed epically with this one. The CGI dwarves were horribly done and took jobs from little people, the costumes looked like they came from the clearance shelf at a Party City, and the whole thing was unnecessary in the first place.

The magic mirror in itself was a travesty, and not even Gal Gadot could save the evil queen's character, which is saying something.

The plot dove off a cliff compared to the original, and it felt less Disney magic and more random movie in the gutters of Tubi.

The only positive thing I have to say is that Rachel Zegler has a beautiful voice.

If I could give this movie less than one star, I definitely would. Rooting for the apple. 1/10.",1/10

All of the really important scenes such as the dwarves heigh ho and the poison apple were included and done well.

I don't agree that the dwarves were creepy. I thought they were alright and dopey was cute. The queen could have been cast better, I wasn't a huge fan of her singing in particular. Overall I think it is way better than everyone on here is saying and as an adult I liked it so I think the kids will love this one!",8/10
"Who thought having this woman play a part in this movie was a good idea.

Disney's decision to cast Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen in the Snow White remake is a complete misstep. The role demands a truly commanding and sinister presence-someone who can embody the Queen's ruthless obsession with beauty and power. Instead, they chose an actress whose performances often feel flat and unconvincing, lacking the depth needed for such an iconic villain.

The Evil Queen is supposed to be chilling, her mere presence sending shivers down the audience's spine. Yet, with this casting, it's hard to imagine anything other than a bland and uninspired portrayal. Her delivery lacks the dramatic weight necessary to make the Queen a truly memorable antagonist. This choice feels lazy, as if Disney simply prioritized star power over actually finding someone who fits the role.

On top of that, her voice alone is a huge issue. The Evil Queen's voice should be commanding and filled with authority, yet here, it will likely feel weak and unthreatening. This role deserved someone with theatrical gravitas, not someone who struggles to bring depth to their performances. Ultimately, this casting decision is yet another sign that Disney is more interested in stunt casting than staying true to what makes Snow White a classic.",1/10

"1 out of 10, would say .5 a star but they wont let me choose that. Why was this a Disney Channel original movie and not given the respect, treatment and love as a adaptation of the the original disney princess like us the audience and like Walt Disney needed???? I am very pleased with Gal Gadot as the evil queen but her over the top queen that was giving a lot of camp and drama could not save the disaster this movie was. Rachel can sing but Snow White is soft, romantic and a touch of opera when she sings, not this loud in your face belt and harsh pronunciation of every word in every song. This was not giving the same power that Jasmine had in her song Speechless, wrong choice of how to empower through song. Slow and steady wins the race and disney needed more time and to listen to us all !!!!!!!!!

I'm honestly speechless the people at Disney watched it and said, ""yeah this is ready for the public"". You would have to be both blind and deaf to even consider rating this anything more than 1 star, and even then I don't think anyone would.

"Rachel Zegler: A Miscast Lead Rachel Zegler, who takes on the iconic role of Snow White, delivers a performance that feels stiff and uninspired. While she undeniably has a strong singing voice, her acting lacks the warmth and charm that made the animated Snow White so beloved. Her line delivery often comes off as forced, and she struggles to bring emotional depth to the character. Instead of exuding the innocence and kindness associated with Snow White, her portrayal feels distant Characters and Relationships: The absence of the traditional prince is replaced by a bland ""bandit guy,"" whose chemistry with Snow White is nonexistent. Their interactions feel awkward and forced, with Snow White repeatedly saving him in scenes that come off as more ridiculous than empowering. Her portrayal as a leader often feels entitled rather than inspiring, especially when the chemistry is forced and lifeless. It's a far cry from the kindness and grace that define the Snow White we know and love.",1/10
"This film is a textbook example of how NOT to do a remake. It takes everything that made the original beloved and replaces it with a lifeless, uninspired mess.

First, let's talk about the lead performance-bland, emotionless, and utterly forgettable. The actress playing Snow White lacks the charm, warmth, and charisma needed for the role. Instead of a strong and endearing heroine, we get a character who feels detached from the world around her.

The CGI? A nightmare. The creatures and backgrounds look artificial, like something from a cheap video game. The dwarfs (or lack thereof) are a complete misfire, removing one of the most iconic elements of the original. Instead, we get a bizarre, soulless attempt at modernizing the story that just falls flat.

And let's not forget the script-awkward, preachy, and devoid of any real heart. Instead of capturing the whimsy and timelessness of the original, the movie hammers audiences with heavy-handed messaging that feels more like a lecture than a fairy tale. The villain? Uninspired. The songs? Unmemorable. The pacing? An absolute slog.

Disney has officially lost its magic with this one. If you loved the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, do yourself a favor-skip this soulless cash grab and rewatch the classic instead.

Rating:1/5 stars (and that's being generous)",1/10
"They say it's a ""remake"" of the animation, but it's basically just an entirely new story at this point. If I could rate it lower, I would. Disney needs to do better; I fear that they have reached their absolute downfall. Just a note for Disney, it's completely fine to embrace romance and femininity. I'm tired of all the remakes with the lack of actual FAIRYTALE elements. This new generation of children have it the worst, the only enjoyment they will have from Disney films will be old gems. I hope this movie will be an eye opener and result in better movies and production. There's so many negatives I have to point out about this movie and many others, honestly just Disney now as a whole, but I can't voice that all in this review. Do better.",1/10
"The OG Snow White, @disney 's first feature animation is one of my all time favourite's, it was a go to as a child and went into the VHS player way too many times to count.

I'm going to be honest, I was sceptical going into it, unsure of what they might have changed or added, but they have expanded the world of Snow White perfectly, will bringing it into the modern era of film and story telling, while keeping the classic old Hollywood charm, it's absolutely wonderful!

Although I would have loved to see live action little people, the CGI Angry, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful, Dopey and Doc are just as charming and adorable as the original, I was worried they would have an uncanny valley creepiness but they don't at all! As soon as I saw Dopey, I was won over!

The new music is fab and intertwines perfectly with the classic tunes you know and love (I can see this now as a great stage musical) plus the sets, the costumes, the animals and the world that's been created is so so well done! If you love Snow White you will love this adaptation!",9/10

Her performances frequently feel rigid, with a monotone delivery that makes it difficult to engage with her characters. While she handles action scenes well, her portrayal of complex emotions tends to be unconvincing, leaving dramatic moments feeling hollow. In roles that demand a greater range of expression, her limited versatility becomes evident, making her performances less impactful than they could be.",1/10
"I'm just wondering if anyone looked at the script or the whole movie when it was finished and said ""damn it can't get any worse than this"".

The performances feel forced, and the dialogue is painfully awkward. The movie tries so hard to be different that it loses all charm and heart. The pacing drags, making it a struggle to stay engaged. The changes to the story feel unnecessary and only weaken the impact. Instead of honoring the original, it turns into a bland, forgettable mess that fails to capture any magic or emotion. It's disappointing from start to finish. It's hard to sit through that kind of film.",1/10
"This film should not be allowed to call itself a remake as the entire plot of the movie was different than the original, and not in a good way. This is supposed to be a love story. It was anything but that. I got so bored during it that I wasn't paying much attention to the end but pretty sure Snow White ended the movie the same way it started, being single. This movie was popular for having a happy ending so why did they decide to get rid of that? The CHI wasn't what it could have been. I'm all for using CGI when it is necessary but making 3 of the most loved and popular characters in the film CGI isn't it. This isn't Godzilla. I'm all for inclusion if you can make it work but why did Snow White look like the prince from Shrek?",1/10
"Disney's live-action remake of ""Snow White"" has been met with widespread criticism, with many labeling it a significant misstep for the studio. Critics have pointed to a muddled storyline, lackluster performances, and controversial deviations from the original 1937 animated classic. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as ""exhaustingly awful,"" criticizing its ""tiresome pseudo-progressive additions"" and calling the performances of Rachel Zegler (Snow White) and Gal Gadot (the Evil Queen) ""the dullest of their lives."" The film's visual choices have also been a point of contention. The use of photorealistic CGI for the seven dwarfs and woodland creatures has been described as unsettling, with some viewers referring to them as ""nightmare fuel.",1/10
"Disgusting movie.wrost actress, wrost wrost worst. Disney's Snow White (2025) is a dull, unnecessary remake that strips away the magic of the original. Rachel Zegler's Snow White feels bland, the seven dwarfs are lifeless CGI, and the story changes add nothing of value. Even Gal Gadot's Evil Queen can't save it.

With weak visuals, forgettable new songs, and a soulless script, this film fails to justify its existence. Some classics are better left untouched. Overall, this Snow White remake is an unnecessary and hollow rehash that fails to justify its existence. Instead of recapturing the magic of the original, it serves as proof that some classics should be left untouched.",1/10
"I feel really bad for the great actors that ended up being in this flop of a movie. And for the up and coming or lesser known actors that were in this movie, it very well be a career ender for them. If Disney needs fresh ideas, then how about hold some focus groups or something like that with regular people. We can give you plenty of new ideas so you quit making subpar remakes of movies that we hold very near and dear from our childhoods. And besides Cinderella, I think Snow White is the most overly remade movie ever. In both animated and live action form. Seriously Disney you have GOT to get it together!",1/10
"Everyone who saw the movie knows exactly what im talking about :/

If not for the god awfull cgi the actor games was also not on par , like gal gadot ofcourse did her thing but zagler just felt like an industry plant nickelodeon kad acting level actress , i coudnt bare to finish the whole movie so i left after watching it for 50 minutes, it was honestly wild how many people were leaving the cinema screening (not that there were that many on that day to begin with) id expect there to be atleast a half full auditorium on a saturday but it was about 20% full and about 10% by the time i decided to also leave, some woman was even asking the cinema back for her money XD.",1/10
"I watched Snow White (2025) at InOrbit's PVR Mx4D, and the experience was nothing short of transportive. The moment the story began to unfold, it wasn't just a cinematic journey-it was an emotional return to my first-grade days at Holy Name High School, Colaba, where fairy tales felt as real as the sea breeze outside our classroom windows.

Directed by Marc Webb and written by Erin Cressida Wilson, Greta Gerwig, and Dorothy Ann Blank, this live-action Disney adaptation stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White, Gal Gadot as the sinister yet mesmerizing Evil Queen, and Andrew Burnap in a supporting role. The film gives the 1937 animated classic a fresh, musical spin-with a Latina Snow White leading the way through a forest of magic, menace, and self-discovery.

Interestingly, as I watched the film in full Mx4D immersion, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was watching a fusion of three classic fairy tales: Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Little Red Riding Hood. Perhaps it was the enchanted slumber, the dark and mysterious forest, or the deceptive appearances of danger wrapped in beauty-it all felt like a richly woven fairy-tale tapestry, where the innocence of youth meets the lurking shadows of fear and fate.

The visual effects were enchanting, the Mx4D effects-from the whooshing forest winds to the jolts of surprise-made every magical moment feel tangible. The performances were sincere, with Zegler bringing a quiet strength to Snow White, and Gal Gadot channeling icy elegance as the Evil Queen.

Though the film is tracking a modest box office opening ($45-55 million), it shines as a heartfelt reimagining that brings Disney's classic to a new generation-with fresh faces, diverse voices, and a modern undercurrent of empowerment.

In the end, it wasn't just a fantasy on screen-it was a mirror into the fairy tales that shaped our childhood imaginations, now retold with emotional depth and dazzling artistry.

Rating: 4/5 A magical, memory-laced journey that blends beloved fairy-tale traditions into a vibrant, emotional adventure. Best enjoyed with wonder-and in Mx4D, if you can!",8/10
"Took my granddaughter to see this opening weekend. Within 15 minutes we were leaving. I mean, she's six and even she knows this take on Snow White was this great big huge dumpster fire.. We wound up going home and watching the original movie on a DVD I purchased for her a few years back for Christmas.

When a six year old gets disgusted and wants to leave, you know you have laid the biggest bomb in Disney history. She's even having second thoughts about going to Disneyland this upcoming summer.

If I found out this thing was being shown on my flight to London next month, I'd still get up and walk out on it.",1/10
Horrible in all aspects What a waste of time It's one movie i wished i slept thru. I wish my kids were shown a better version . This was just bad all the way around . And the cast was mediocre at best It was a long time since i've suffered thru this type of torture The actress playing snow white was really bad She should think about another career what happened to the version where you and your kids could enjoy it as a family? I saw that the movie flopped opening weekend and i now know why! The others viewers at the show that i saw seemed basically all around disappointed too. If a refund was offered it still wouldn't make up for the lost time!,1/10
"Talk about ruining a classic. It's hard to believe that they would do such a lousy job when all they needed to do was a live action of the original. The original is a beloved classic that has been passed down for generations for a reason...because it's great! Why change anything? I truly don't get it, it's like Disney tries to find ways to lose money. If you guys wanted to make a difference movie then just make an original movie. The point of a live action remake is to bring the original movie to life....this really isn't that difficult to understand. When will shareholders finally have enough of current management? Do yourself a favor and just watch the original film.",1/10
"I did not enjoy this movie at all, the casting was terrible and Gal Gadot has never been a worthy actress of Hollywood, never mind putting her in a lead role to carry a lead character of such an iconic children's tale. Sorry Disney you got this one very wrong and I sat there willing for the movie to end. Additionally, my children didn't buy into the characters and storyline dragged out. The only saving grace of the movie was Rachel Zegler, whose sweet performance carried the movie to counter the bad acting of the Evil stepmother. Sadly, the plot is all over the place and there were too many styles layered over each other.. it's a No from me!",1/10
"For all the money poured into this film, you'd think it would at least look good. Instead, we're stuck with embarrassingly bad CGI that makes every scene feel fake and lifeless. The original classic is completely lost in this uninspired portrayal, stripped of its heart and magic.

The casting choice for Snow White was a major misstep-where is the warmth, the kindness, the charm? Instead of embodying the beloved character, the performance feels forced and detached. The music is forgettable, the acting uninspired, and the entire backdrop feels like a cheap green-screen disaster.

There's no wonder, no joy, and certainly no reason to revisit this mess. Disney needs to stop butchering their classics if they can't even capture the spirit of what made them beloved in the first place.",2/10
"Honestly, if it weren't for the bloated production budget and Gal Gadot looking like she just stepped out of a Vogue editorial, the 2025 Snow White remake would've felt right at home as a forgettable Disney+ exclusive. Visually polished but emotionally empty, the film lacks the charm, heart, and timeless storytelling that made the original iconic. At this point, you could probably use AI to stitch together a better version with clips from the 1937 classic and a dash of actual fairy tale magic. Disney needs to stop recycling old IPs into hollow shells and start actually imagining again - not filtering every story through a corporate-approved lens that strips away soul, risk, and wonder.",1/10

"This movie was charming, sweet and a absolute true children's fairy tale. Rachel Ziegler is the star of the show. Her voice is enchanting. I enjoyed gal Gadot as the evil queen , her costumes were breathtaking. Children will love this movie, which is exactly what it's for. Take your families, your children, your grandchildren. It's a simple classic tale. I think Disney did a good job paying respect to the original movie while adding their own music to this new version. Only thing I did not like were the bandit characters. Probably my top three Disney live action remakes now. I hope people will take their children and give this movie a chance. It doesn't deserve the hate. It's beyond ridiculous now.",8/10
"Such an unnecessary remake - not to mention they completely missed the vibe of the classic story. They claimed to follow the plot, but they really didn't. Rachel didn't do well in the role; her acting wasn't good. The only thing I can give her credit for is the singing. Gal Gadot, whom I actually really like, also gave a weak performance. I won't even comment on the dwarfs - in my opinion, if you're making a live action and have the chance, you should cast real people to play the roles. The CGI was bad. The prince isn't even a real prince, and what was that gang about? Half the movie was just filler with nothing happening. Overall, a big disappointment.",2/10
"I saw it for free, so thankfully I didn't have to spend funds. Don't spend funds to see this. It is not worth the film it's shot on. I will say Rachel has a very good singing voice. But the cast does not work in this. Gal is supposed to be jealous of Rachel?? Anyone with eyes knows thats just not a thing. Gal does a good job with the villain song, going a little over the top like you'd think a villain would. This is originally about 7 dwarves, that was the take away for most people from the original. Now the dwarves are animated horrible, but besides the 7 dwarves there's also 7 bandits who just come put of left field. They name one of the bandits like were supposed to know who that is and we dont. There was a 7yr old and she is really into snow white and other Disney right now, and two 9 yr Olds watching with me. There was also about a dozen other parents with kids in as well. There was literally 2 laughs through the whole film. Not 2 times when everyone laughed, 2 individual laughs through the whole theater through the whole film. All 3 kids wanted to use the bathroom about halfway through. Then they wanted to leave once we were done in the restrooms, but we went back and finished the film. All 3 said ""it was ok"". IT WAS NOT OK! It's too long, seems like about 45 mins longer than the original, which i see about 3 to 5xs a week at home right now thanks to my little one. This FELT alot longer than the original. This film drags, and feels very uneventful. Nothing was very memorable. I didn't enjoy it and neither did any of the kids. Don't waste your money. If you bring kids you'll probably be interacting with them more than watching the movie because they won't be captured by the film and theyll want to leave...",2/10
"Honestly the movie wasnt as bad as i thought it would be and i think Rachel Zegler did okay. However... gal gadot.. she cant act for anything and her expressions always ruin it for me... 1/10. I wish they didnt include her in this movie and she was point blank, the worst thing in this movie and everytime she appeared on screen i wanted to skip forward and not see her at all. Awful awful.

Overall, I wish the movie was more magical and a little more whimsy like and im still upset about the cgi use of dwarves. Totally let down on that part and I really was expecting a lot of magical elements but oh well.",1/10
"Snow White (2025) - A Disappointing Retelling with a Weak Villain

Disney's Snow White promised to bring a fresh take on the beloved classic, but unfortunately, it falls flat-especially due to Gal Gadot's uninspired performance as the Evil Queen.

Gadot's portrayal lacks the depth, menace, and charisma needed to bring this iconic villain to life. Instead of exuding the chilling, regal presence of the original Evil Queen, she delivers stiff line readings and an almost cartoonish overperformance. Her attempt at villainy feels forced rather than natural, making it hard to take her seriously as a threat. It's as if she's simply reciting lines rather than truly embodying the role.

The rest of the film doesn't fare much better. The modernized changes to the story feel unnecessary and fail to capture the magic that made Snow White a timeless tale. The visuals are impressive, but all the CGI in the world can't make up for weak storytelling and lackluster acting.

Ultimately, Snow White is a missed opportunity. With stronger casting choices-especially for the villain-it might have had a chance. But as it stands, it's yet another disappointing live-action remake that proves not every classic needs to be retold.",1/10
"The entirety of the movie is blend and with no life. The acting, especially of Gal Gadot is unalive and not matching the character and it's visuals. The songs are forgettable and boring. The CGI quality is acceptable but the integration with the actors is bad and takes you out of the univers the movie tries to put you in. The only good part about the movie it is the set and costume design. In conclusion the movie is bad and boring all the new plot is generic. If you want to watch it you would be better rewatching the original. At least I could laugh a little bit with the terrible acting in the movie.",2/10
"Disney's live-action remake of *Snow White* stumbles down a well-trodden path that feels more like a cash grab than a creative endeavor. While the original's charm lay in its timeless simplicity, this remake attempts to modernize but lacks the heart and magic of its predecessor. The visual effects fail to impress, and the casting choices, though talented, struggle to bring depth to the rehashed script. Disney's obsession with reimagining classics in live-action dilutes their legacy and begs the question: Why not focus on bold, original storytelling instead of recycling past glories?

Please stop with the live action remakes.",1/10
"After being determined to totally disregard all the pre-reviews and reporting and focus on the final product, we were very disappointed.

This movie in no way holds up any of the standards Disney has committed to in the past.

This does not even begin to resemble a true Disney film from this era or the past. If it is the future of Disney then the entire studio is dead.

Storyline, acting, editing and even the lighting was inconsistent and distracting.

For the amount of time it took to get the picture made and edited, one would think there would have been plenty of time to focus group this production and make changes to make it somewhat entertaining.

Sitting through the entire production felt as if the producers were trying to make us like their new vision of filmmaking.

Afterwards discussed it and tried to decided it maybe it was the Wizard of Oz effect. Over the present audiences' head, and later a classic. In no way could this be true.

As HUGE Disney fans we will leave it as DISAPPOINTING.",1/10
"What an epic waste of time and ressources.

Was invited to see it, and was a bit hesitant because of all the ""noise"" about the movie. But OMG it was bad.

Only positive thing was that Zegler could carry a tune, but songs where dull and AI written it seems, devoid of any soul.

And as an afterthought, it is quite amazing that Disney would cast the least attractive woman in the movie as ""the fairest of them all"", but seems like they have gotten everything turned upside down in this very very very slow moving carcrash of a movie. The popcorn and cola was ok though, and not nearly as overpriced as the movie.",2/10
Great casting. New songs beautifully done. Great special effects. Loved it. I enjoyed the updated twists to the old classic. Only I wish Gal Gadot wasn't so evil even if she was cast as the evil queen. Hope to see more Disney movies that I can take my kids too. Also more Disney for adults. Thanks for a diversity in your policies. Keep your stand Disney. We love what you do. So I have not enough words to submit this? I don't want to enter any spoilers so all I can do is reiterate the facts that the music and singing was top notch. Costume of Snow White was right on and the seven dwarfs looked soo real.,10/10

"Where do I begin? This remake of Snow White is a dull, joyless attempt at reimagining a classic that didn't need fixing. The storyline has been changed. The heart and charm of the original are completely lost in a sea of awkward dialogue, lifeless performances, and forgettable visuals. Costumes look like they were purchased from Temu. Snow White herself feels more like a lecture than a character, and the film seems more concerned with messaging than storytelling. It's not magical, it's not fun-it's just... there. Disney really missed the mark on this one. This has been another failed attempt to bring back a classic.",1/10
"Yeah I had tickets for this or else I literally wouldn't have paid to see it. Friend of mine got some promo tickets, he couldn't go any my wife wanted to see it so we went. Halfway through she said to me, ""this is bad but at least she can sing"".

There's been so much controversy over this movie in the past few months and I'll say this, casting Rachel Zegler as Snow White was not the biggest problem in this. No, there's loads of them.

The story itself has changed, the CGI Dwarfs look terrible, Gal Gadot is beyond hot and somehow Rachel Zegler is supposed to be prettier? The idea of the seven members of the thief's party might have originally been supposed to be stand ins for the Seven Dwarfs... oh sorry ""magical creatures"". And what's their magic? They touch the gems in the cave and they glow. Ooooh! Special.

Then there's the fact it's not a love story. The original is about the handsome prince kissing her to wake her up. Now it's she learns to be the leader she always was meant to be.

In the end it's another soulless cash grab by Disney who are just remaking their classic cartoons.

But as my wife said, at least she can sing.",2/10
"A bad film, really wasted my Sunday evening watching this one.

It's frustrating to watch as the story lacks as much depth as the characters, Gals performance is shocking throughout too. A very interesting choice of character given the current the recent human rights abuses, particularly to children, and war crimes by the country she is frequently used to represent. Overall really underwhelming. It somehow lacks

The characters lacked depth, warmth, and charm, it somehow managed to feel completely soulless throughout. The film lacked anything to remember. Will not be watching again and suggest others save their time.",1/10
"Gal has had a horrible performance as expected. But it was so bad that even horrible doesn't spell it out.

From the beginning to the end, the movie lacked character. ""Snow White"" was an absolute disaster, thanks mostly to the gal who played the lead. Her performance was flatter than a fairy tale pancake-zero charm, no chemistry, and she looked like she'd rather be anywhere else. Instead of bringing Snow White to life, she dragged the character into a coma. The forest animals had more emotional range. If this was meant to be a reimagining, someone forgot to imagine anything worth watching. Absolute nonsense.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White is already controversial, but Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen makes it even worse. She looks the part, but the second she speaks, the illusion is shattered. Her stiff delivery, awkward line reading, and complete lack of menace make her less of a fearsome villain and more of a campy cartoon. Instead of exuding power, she feels like she's playing dress-up. A good villain should be chilling, but Gadot's Evil Queen is just embarrassing. This casting choice proves that not every big-name star is suited for every role. It was a very bad experience and don't recommend watching this movie.",1/10
"Snow White (2024) is a disappointing and unnecessary remake that completely misses the charm and magic of the original. Instead of honoring the classic, the film feels like a forced reimagining that lacks heart and substance. The writing is uninspired, the characters feel flat, and the changes to the story seem more like an attempt to make a statement rather than enhance the narrative. Snow White herself is unrecognizable, stripped of the qualities that made her an iconic character. The removal of the dwarfs, a crucial part of the original story, only makes the film feel emptier. On top of that, the CGI-heavy visuals fail to capture the fairy tale atmosphere, making everything look artificial and lifeless. If you love the original, this movie will likely leave you frustrated rather than enchanted. Instead of remaking beloved classics, Disney should focus on creating new, original stories that actually respect their audience.",1/10
"I would rate the Snow White movie a 1 because it completely strays from the essence of the original story in an attempt to be overly inclusive. While diversity in films is important, it should not come at the cost of erasing key elements that define a classic tale.

One of the biggest issues is that the film excludes real dwarfs, replacing them with average-sized actors. This is not only unfair to little people who could have had a significant opportunity in Hollywood, but it also removes an essential part of the traditional Snow White narrative. The original fairy tale is deeply rooted in the story of Snow White and the seven dwarfs-altering this takes away from its authenticity.",1/10
"Snow White is fine. It's not a frame-by-frame remake; and, it's definitely its own interpretation of the story. If you go expecting a live action duplicate of the original you will be disappointed. If you go in with the idea that it's a refreshed movie with honoring parts of the original it'll be more enjoyable. My kids and I both liked it and enjoyed to music. Rachel Zegler has a beautiful voice. I found the musical numbers for Gal Gadot did detract from the Queen's scariness, but other than that, it's an easy fun movie that's appropriate for the target audience. It is in not the best movie ever made by far, but it in no means the worst either. It's a pleasant fun take on a classic that doesn't need to be taken so seriously.",8/10
"Everything in this movie felt kinda dead and soulless to me. I think it's cause the visuals are such a hot mess, some parts being perfectly polished and others being unfinished. Parts of the scenery were gorgeous but then I'd see the dwarves and felt like they belonged to an entire different world and story. It didn't feel cohesive at all, the story wasn't able to pull it together either. Nor was the acting. The story is very predictable and badly written, the is acting kinda meh.

I usually don't really enjoy the songs in these movies, but due to everything else being so lackluster they were the best part of the movie imo, I'd never listen to them again on purpose though.",1/10
"As always, whenever there's a negative hype around a movie, my mindset is always, prove them wrong, give it a chance.

It's diabolical, honestly, I can't understand how so much money and so much time has gone into this, the final result is cringe worthy. It is an absolute shocker, I am stumped to find any positives.

It looks and feels so artificial, the sets, the animals, as for The Dwarves themselves, I have no words to express my feelings there.

The biggest catastrophe, not what I was expecting if I'm honest, the worst offender, Gal Gadot, she looks sensational, but her performance, she's going to scoop some unwanted awards it's fair to say.

What I wasn't expecting, was just how poor the costumes would look on screen, Snow White's just doesn't translate very well, the hairstyle, what were they thinking?

Disney, what on Earth have you done?",1/10
"Can't believe they actually made this monster of movie ?

Snow White"" feels like a rushed, uninspired production with shockingly low-budget visuals.

The costumes look like cheap cosplay, the CGI is laughable, and the sets lack any depth or creativity. It fails to capture the magic or charm expected from a fairytale adaptation.

The writing is bland, the acting feels forced, and the overall presentation is disappointingly generic.

Instead of a grand cinematic experience, it comes off as a soulless cash grab with little effort put into world-building or storytelling.

A massive letdown. I hope disney never recovers from this. This is terrible.

My grandmother of 96 years is a huge Disney fan but especially a Snow White fan. I rolled her into the movie theatre at AMC which has spectacular seating and we began the film. About a half hour into it I couldn't believe my eyes . My grandma began to move her legs side to side and began rising from her wheelchair. She hasn't walked in over 15 years and for the first time since she walked right out of the theatre . I informed the people within the theatre and that was the only applause the entire film I believe. Leave the classics alone .

I was invites to watch this film, and Even for free It felt like I shouldnt have been there at all.

Please do not waste tour time, it's just awful, terrible cgi, right into the uncanny valley.

Im just so disgusted, i find hard to choose the words tonexpress It. Disney must change it's way asap, the gemeration that grew up loving Classic films is alteady dissaponted, and new generations have nothing to admire now.

This company is digging their own grave at a super fast pace, getting closer and closer to the point of no return.

"So much talent, so much money invested in a project and the results are mediocre at best. You guys even had a how to from the previous works of art done with this subject. I honestly don't understand why you do this to yourselves and the rest of us. I still went to the cinema, supported the work and dragged a victim along with me. She had similar thoughts. Perhaps in the future learn from past mistakes and only take calculated risks, you guys have semi unlimited budgets and the loyalty of all of us, give the people what they want, we will show our gratitude by supporting projects instead of having to suffer through them.",1/10
"The lead performance is underwhelming, with little charisma or depth. The supporting cast feels wasted, especially the dwarfs, who barely get any development. The CGI is hit-or-miss, often looking artificial and lacking the enchantment you'd expect from a fairytale. The pacing drags, making the already thin plot feel stretched beyond its limits.

Most disappointing is how the film loses sight of the heart and wonder of the original story. Instead of embracing the timeless themes of love, kindness, and bravery, it pushes a narrative that feels disconnected from what made Snow White a beloved tale in the first place.

Overall, this adaptation is forgettable at best and frustrating at worst. If you're looking for a faithful or engaging retelling, this isn't it.",1/10
"When is Disney going to learn, we don't want Broadway. Give us our childhood memories new life and fun without the obnoxiously occuring boring tunes to get whoever their five minutes. There is no need for four new songs in the first 12 minutes. How can someone seriously let Snow White be this messed up? Actress for Snow White is great and dwarves are fun but why can't we get an actress for the Queen (top two iconic villians for Disney) who brings the character from the original to life? Of all the films in the history of Disney, you would think this would be taken with the most hearfelt thought for getting it right. Sorry Walt.",2/10
"Her acting was just so atrocious that it ruined the movie for me and all the family. Surprised she is recognised as an actress.

I was shocked to hear she got the role as she has just failed to add anything to movies since her debut. A real let down by casting from Disney. They need coaching on morals as well as how to pick the actors for movies. I think I've given up on Disney, flop after flop. Rachel actually did a good job but this was a titanic failure where one person couldn't save this sinking ship.

I don't think I'll be wasting any money on Disney any more. This movie IS REALLY bad. Hope this helps.",1/10
"Well, it certainly is it's own thing. I love the original film, and when this was announced I was excited to see Gal Gadot is in it. Mind you, not the role I would have cast her for.

The film itself, lacks character and the songs lack everything. I don't know why they would remake this classic and turn it up on its head, but it certainly is its own monster.

It is missing that Disney Magic, when a film grabs your body and soul, only to become so entwined with the very essence of the film. This doesn't have it, which is sad because Snow White is a wonderful fairy tale.

I tried hard to like it, or to find something positive to say, other than Gal Gadot is beautiful. As my review starts she is the only reason I went to go see it. I am not sad about it, I am sad about the film.",2/10
"We took a whole crew of kids to see this film, and I have to admit that it has lost that Disney ability to make you feel wonder and magic. I did not feel it to be uplifting, but rather 'hollow', like it was just going thru the motions. The music is nice, but from there it is nothing compared to the original, which all the adults on the trip had seen in their youth and found it to be an enchanting experience. The rumors of Zeigler being a bit wooden and bossy turned out to be true, but the kids did not seem to notice, They did start talking to each other pretty early in the film and that is a bad sign!",3/10
"Gal Gadot's as of the Evil Queen in Snow White is, unfortunately, a major misstep. Her performance falls flat in almost every other aspect. Her line delivery lacks the depth and menace needed for such an iconic role, making her character feel more like a cartoonish exaggeration than a truly intimidating force.

One of the biggest issues with Gadot's acting is her emotional range-or lack thereof. Rather than bringing a nuanced, layered villain to life, her performance comes across as forced and unnatural. Instead of exuding an effortless aura of wickedness, her delivery feels stiff and overly rehearsed. The Evil Queen should command the screen with a chilling presence, but Gadot's portrayal feels more like a parody, as if she's trying too hard to be menacing without actually achieving it.

Another glaring flaw is how she handles the dialogue.",1/10

The VFX backdrops looked like they didn't have the budget to finish them. The dwarves did not fit in the movie. They were noticeably and distractingly fake. It didn't look like a Disney movie. There was no magic. No theme or message I could take away. There wasn't a lot of emotion. It's such a shame that Disney ruined the original movie that made Walt Disney who he was.

The new Snow White movie, directed by Marc Webb and featuring Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, is a breathtaking reimagining of the beloved classic that successfully intertwines nostalgia with modern storytelling. With stunning visuals, a powerful soundtrack, and a fresh take on character development, this film is a must-see for both fans of the original and newcomers alike.

From the very first scene, the film captivates audiences with its enchanting visuals. The cinematography is nothing short of spectacular, showcasing lush forests, vibrant colors, and intricate set designs that bring the fairy tale world to life. Each frame feels like a painting, drawing viewers into the magical realm where Snow White resides. The attention to detail in costume design also deserves praise, as it beautifully reflects the characters' personalities and the film's overall aesthetic.

Rachel Zegler delivers a remarkable performance as Snow White, embodying the character's innocence, strength, and determination. Unlike the traditional portrayal of Snow White as merely a damsel in distress, this version presents her as a proactive and resilient young woman who is not afraid to stand up for herself and fight against injustice. Zegler's vocal talents shine in several musical numbers, adding depth to her character and making her journey even more relatable. Her chemistry with the supporting cast, particularly the seven dwarfs, is heartwarming and adds a layer of camaraderie that enhances the overall narrative.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is equally impressive. She brings a commanding presence to the role, effectively capturing the character's complexity. The film delves into the Queen's backstory, exploring her motivations and insecurities, which adds depth to her villainy. Gadot's performance is both fierce and vulnerable, making her a formidable antagonist while also eliciting sympathy from the audience. The dynamic between Snow White and the Evil Queen is central to the story, and their encounters are filled with tension and emotional weight.

The film's soundtrack is another standout feature, with original songs that perfectly complement the story. The music, composed by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, captures the essence of the characters and their journeys. Each song is intricately woven into the narrative, enhancing key moments and evoking a range of emotions. The musical numbers are choreographed beautifully, making them a joy to watch and listen to. The blend of classic fairy tale themes with contemporary musical styles creates a unique auditory experience that resonates with audiences of all ages.

One of the most significant aspects of this adaptation is its emphasis on themes of empowerment and self-discovery. The film encourages viewers to embrace their individuality and fight for what they believe in. Snow White's journey is not just about finding love but also about discovering her own strength and purpose. This modern twist on the story resonates strongly with today's audiences, making it relevant and inspiring.

While the film pays homage to the original animated classic, it also takes bold steps to innovate and challenge traditional narratives. The inclusion of diverse characters and perspectives adds richness to the story, allowing for a broader representation that reflects our world today. The seven dwarfs, portrayed by a talented ensemble cast, are given distinct personalities and backstories, making them more than just side characters. Their camaraderie with Snow White is heartwarming and adds layers to the film's narrative.

In terms of pacing, the film flows seamlessly, balancing moments of action, drama, and lightheartedness. The screenplay is well-crafted, with witty dialogue and poignant moments that keep the audience engaged throughout. The film's climax is thrilling and emotional, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats and ultimately delivering a satisfying conclusion.

Overall, the new Snow White movie is a triumph that successfully blends nostalgia with modern sensibilities. With its stunning visuals, powerful performances, and a compelling narrative, it stands out as a remarkable adaptation of a beloved fairy tale. This film is not just for children; it appeals to audiences of all ages, making it a cinematic experience worth sharing with family and friends. It's a refreshing reminder of the timelessness of fairy tales and the importance of courage, friendship, and self-empowerment. Without a doubt, this Snow White deserves a solid 10/10 for its artistic vision and heartfelt storytelling.",10/10
"If you enjoy getting disappointed, this is the perfect movie for you! It's like they took the classic tale, tossed it in a blender, and hit ""randomize."" The dwarfs? Sad. The magic? Vanished. The fun? Buried under layers of unnecessary changes. Snow White isn't even waiting for a prince, she's too busy being a modern hero in a film that forgot to have any heart. The dialogue feels like it was written by someone who skimmed the original story once and decided they could do better. If you love movies that ignore what made the original special, this one's a masterpiece. Otherwise, save yourself the time and just watch paint dry. It's more magical and has better character development.",1/10
"The most disappointing remake of Snow White, and I'm still trying to process how they managed to mess it up so badly. The film is a complete disaster, with Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen being one of the worst aspects.

Her acting skills, or lack thereof, are painfully evident throughout the movie. She fails to deliver even the simplest lines convincingly, making her character come across as more cartoonish than menacing. And don't even get me started on her singing - it's cringe-worthy.

But Gadot's poor performance isn't the only issue with this remake. The film's attempt to modernize the classic tale falls flat, with new songs that feel forced and out of place. The CGI dwarfs are also a major misstep, looking more like creepy animatronics than lovable characters.

The only bright spot in the movie is Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White. She's a talented actress with a beautiful singing voice, but even she can't save this sinking ship.

Overall, I'd give this remake a solid 2 out of 10. It's a mess from start to finish, with poor performances, lackluster music, and a misguided attempt to update a classic tale. Avoid it at all costs.",2/10
"I've got no words for the new disney movies anymore... Just a big disappointment through and through, which is quite sad because snow-white was one of my favorite childhood movies and I didn't expect them to mess it up THIS badly.

Rachel Ziegler is an amazing actor, but she was not made for this movie.

The CGI was terrible at points, worse than in previous movies and I still have no clue why they didn't cast real people to play the seven dwarves... Even my CHILDREN, who have seen the original, did not enjoy the movie, which tells a lot about it in my opinion... I hope they don't mess up Rapunzel this badly as well.",1/10
"Few -- if any -- films have experienced the pre-release analysis and criticism Snow White has endured. Those of us who have chosen to await the final cut's release have met with pretty much what was anticipated in the extensive earlier discussion.

A minority will laud Disney's revisionist version. The majority of the (potential) audience will mourn their departure from the wonders of the original. Little more to be said on that subject.

One positive note comes in the performance of Gal Gadot (which saves the musical from a one star rating). She is excellent as the evil step mother lusting to preserve her rule. Some may criticize her performance as lacking ""range,"" but that is the nature of this archetype.

Gadot plays the evil temptress adroitly: alluring, deceptive, cunning, and vindictive. Kudos to Gadot for being a bright/dark light in an otherwise disappointing film.",2/10
"Disney's live-action Snow White is a disappointing, unnecessary remake that fails to capture the magic of the original. The story is cluttered, the pacing is slow, and the tone feels inconsistent. Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the warmth and innocence of the animated version, while Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is over-the-top in a way that feels more silly than menacing. The decision to remove the seven dwarfs and replace them with generic ""magical companions"" makes the film feel even more hollow. Instead of honoring the original, Disney delivers a soulless, forced update that nobody asked for. Sorry.",1/10
"My daughter came down so I wanted to spend some father daughter time with her. So I took my daughter that is now in college. She grew up loving the original Disney animated movie, she had the dresses and would watch the DVD non stop. I wish I could get my two hours back and my money, my daughter was so frustrated with it that I had to talk her into staying for the whole thing. It's unfortunate they felt like they had to destroy such a beautiful classic.

I would recommend waiting till it comes out on Disney plus or somewhere else you do not have to pay for it. All I can say is I am very let down and disappointed in Disney.",1/10
"Disney's 2025 Snow White is a dull and unnecessary remake that fails to capture the magic of the original. The story feels clunky and hollow, stripping away the charm that made the classic so beloved. The visuals and set designs lack creativity, making the world feel uninspired. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is forgettable, lacking menace, while Rachel Zegler's Snow White, though talented, can't save the weak script. The film tries too hard to modernize the story but loses its heart in the process. A disappointing misstep that proves not every classic needs a remake. In the end, it's just another forgettable addition to Disney's growing list of lackluster live-action adaptations.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is a disappointing remake that fails to capture the magic and heart of the original. Instead of honoring the beloved fairy tale, it changes key elements in ways that feel unnecessary and forced, stripping away the charm that made the classic so timeless. The story is barely recognizable, the CGI feels artificial, and the overall film lacks soul. The performances feel uninspired, and the script is dull, making it hard to stay engaged. This isn't an update-it's a rewrite that misses the mark, failing to bring anything truly worthwhile to the table. A lifeless adaptation that leaves longtime fans disappointed and wishing Disney had left this classic untouched.",1/10
"One of Disney's best live action. An updated one of Disney's best live action. An updated Snowhite that maintains its essence, full of magic, with new catchy songs that they contribute. Rachel is incredible, and it's Snowhite. It has incredible photography and colors, the CGI, although it could be improved, ends up getting you into the story and becoming fond of the dwarves. Definitely a live action that is worth it. Highly recommended, especially for the little ones. The new Snowhite gives a modern twist to the story that we all know and love, respecting the original and providing freshness, magic and adventure.",10/10
"How you gonna make a movie about a princess falling in love and change it completely and make the character not look like how she is supposed to they need to make a new movie and do it right and maybe actually give little people a roll they can play instead of take it away from them. This needs to be better and people would watch and enjoy it why have a actor who don't even like the original film stop ruining the classics and make your own movie on something and not change to whatever this is. Also please disney start making the actors look like the characters instead of changing them it would make the movies way more liked like mulan, sleeping beauty, beauty and the beast.",1/10

"New that shouldn't exist. The story only exists because it is what it is. They made a mistake in trying to create something. They shouldn't even have the slightest mention of what the first film was, not even a name, not even characters, not even an allusion. Do you want something new? CREATE IT! Don't try to remodel it. Those who watch it already know the story and want to remember it, watch it again or watch it in a modern way... but not this modern way. As for inspiration for new generations... forget it! Not even the trailer is good enough. They made mistakes, and they made mistakes like Murphy, in the worst way, at the worst time, in a way that causes more pain... ready Snow White 2025.",1/10
"Changes, are brutality done, actress is horrible, it's a mess! It is brutally obvious they struggled with the script and music. They should have been less focused on changes and more focused on making a good and coherent product. The movie is mostly visually appealing, the dwarfs and pretty bad.... No idea why they would make the changes to this classic that they did. Disney has been mostly respectful with plot changes in other live action remakes, but sadly not this attempt. We are use to them casting diverse people in roles that they are inappropriate for and setting them up to fail! When the description of the character clearly states physical characteristics.... It would be a good idea to stick to the program, as it is distracting to the audience and takes a lot of people out of the moment.

Disney, do better!",1/10
"I adored the original snow white film as a kid. I watched it so many times. It was magical. It was wonderful, it was a beautiful fantasy. It was everything a child could ask for.

When I heard the new snow white had come out. I desperately wanted it to recapture the magic of the 1937 film. I sat through the whole film. Oh, dear dear me. What an awful, horrible mess. I was thinking of leaving. But I had my children with me and I thought, may as well sit through it. I've paid for the ticket. - But, oh dear me, I wish I had left before the end. This was an absolute shambles of a movie. Disney has absolutely lost the plot. So sad. So very very sad. How did they get this so wrong?",2/10
"This movie is a complete disaster. The plot is all over the place, with no clear direction or purpose. Characters make irrational decisions, and the supposed ""twists"" feel forced and incoherent. It's as if the writers forgot the basics of storytelling, leaving huge gaps in logic and continuity. The dialogue is cringeworthy, and the acting doesn't do much to save it. Rather than being a thrilling or thought-provoking experience, this movie is just a confusing mess that left me frustrated and disappointed. It's a waste of time from start to finish. I would not suggest this to anyone else. This was just not the movie.",1/10
"Disney, did you not see this happening? Did you not see? Signs of it at all. From the get-go, this all should've been warning signs, but nothing was done about it. Hopefully, you guys learn from this and move forward making better movies and if your lead actress starts acting out many times I don't know. Maybe you guys should do something about it. Maybe you should delay the movie and try to find a better person that's more suited to doing the job correctly and not just destroying a good classic from the past. Remember this moving forward and not try to rush it. Do better next time this was a major disappointment.",1/10
"You can tell there were re-shoots the magical friends or whatever they call them that were supposed to replace the dwarves seemed like they weren't a part of the story, but we were meant to believe that we knew these characters. Of course, Rachel Zegler can sing there's no doubt, but the acting is off. The Queen song was super cheesy, i'm very campy which would've been fine if the movie was good. The movie isn't good. I took my children to see it because they love the original and I grew up with the original. We left right before the end because it was just terrible. I'm not sure what Disney is doing or thinking anymore, if you want a family film and go see DreamWorks movie. Don't waste your money on this.",1/10

"Snow White (2025) isn't just bad-it's an unholy collision of soulless corporate meddling, dreadful acting, and CGI so cheap it might as well have been rendered on a broken iPhone.

Marc Webb's direction? If you could fail upwards in filmmaking, this is the masterclass. The movie has no idea what it wants to be. It viciously guts the spirit of the original tale, then stands over the corpse, smugly patting itself on the back for being ""modern."" It's not a reimagining-it's an identity crisis in HD.

The visuals are a joke. The forest looks like a cheap TikTok filter gone rogue. The so-called ""dwarves"" aren't actors-they're CGI nightmares, uncanny and lifeless, who look like they were copied and pasted from three different unfinished Pixar projects. Their musical numbers are physically painful to sit through, awkwardly shoehorned in and completely out of tune with the tone (if there even is one).

Now Rachel Zegler... look, she can sing. That's the one-and only-bright spot in this dumpster fire. Her voice is beautiful. But everything else? Completely falls apart. Her acting is wooden, smug, and emotionless. She delivers her lines like she's reading off cue cards behind the camera, and she carries the role with the energy of someone who doesn't want to be Snow White at all. Her version of the character is about as likable as a tax audit.

And Gal Gadot? Somehow both over-the-top and underwhelming. Her Evil Queen doesn't command the screen-she hijacks it and derails the entire tone of the movie with every eye-roll and overacted sneer.

This film can't find its own identity, yet it bends over backward to distance itself from the original-completely misunderstanding why Snow White is beloved in the first place. It throws away charm, heart, and warmth in exchange for cheap empowerment clichés and a cold, hollow script that lectures more than it entertains.

In short: Snow White (2025) is what happens when a classic story is handed to people who neither understand nor respect it. It's a glitter-coated trainwreck of epic proportions.

Spare yourself the ticket. Watch paint dry-it has more soul, better pacing, and probably a more believable cast.",1/10
"Really very bad.

Lets put aside the actress personility in the real world. I cannot believe a woman with evil facial expression, doing dumb things, talk impolitely qualified as a princess. May be this is what people think it is 'beautiful' for now?

Some people said the dance scence is great, but actually I dont think they are fun at all. Especially the dwarf singing in the cave, it is just a waste of CG. In the past CG is used to make special effect, create things that cannot be create in the real world, like 'Pacific Rim 1"" and ""Enchanted"", but now it create 7 ugly creatures dance in fancy cave.

And I dont know why the movie keep mentioned the diamond and gems, it is pointless. Those gems is as coomon as Foxs candy in the film.",1/10
"Gal Gadot was the only watchable part of this total mess. Nothing made sense in the plot, most of the characters were bland, pointless and didn't seem to matter much at all in relation to anything the movie was trying to do (Gal Gadot, the exception again, character well framed, solid acting and powerful screen presence, all the things strikingly absent in Zegler's one dimensional lead 'thing' - I hesitate to use 'character' here). Disney really needs to learn a lot of important lessons from this project. If they keep putting out irrelevant, self-important projects like this, they'll bankrupt themselves. But then again, that might not be a bad thing for us, the audience.",1/10
"You don't change Shakespeare this was a piece of art, outdated or not deserves respect, if you want a diferent princess , create a new one, I'm from 91, I expected Snow White, the dragon the prince charming and a love story, not this, not even a actress speaking the worst about this story, grow up and respect ! This was a disappointment. And come on, you make dwarfs at computer that obviously the actress didn't know how to deal with them, and the. Put a real dwarfs on the prince gang, prince that is not a prince anymore to be a thief? Shameful. After that, no dragon? No battle ? As I said make new princesses , don't mess with our classics was lady's with they're 50 disappointed on my cinema session saying that this is shameful!",1/10
"I don't understand the hype around Snow White. The story is painfully slow, the characters are one-dimensional, and Snow White herself is more annoying than endearing. The Evil Queen is the only interesting character, but even she makes some ridiculously bad decisions. The animation might have been groundbreaking for its time, but watching it now feels outdated and dull. I struggled to stay awake, and the constant singing didn't help at all. The dwarfs are forgettable, and the prince is barely in the movie. Definitely not the ""timeless classic"" everyone claims it to be. 1/5 stars. Bad bad bad bad.",1/10
"Ok soooo I really wanted to like it. One of my favorite broadway actors Hadley Frasier has a small roll in the movie but it was so cringeworthy. I walked out halfway through and never have done that before. There was nothing even remotely ""charming"" about this live action film. I thought the last couple Disney live action remakes were bad but this made them look like masterpieces. The music was bad the story was even worse if you work hard Don't waste your money. It's a shame because it felt rushed and since Snow White is such a classic it could have been as good or better than Cinderella. Bad choice of cast makes an even worse movie.",1/10
"I wouldn't waste my time and money after not watching this movie. I do not recommend this for you to watch this, because I haven't. If you really really absurdly want to waste your time and money, then watch Dragon ball Evolution. Not this. If I had 1h 49mins left to live, I would rather stare at a white blank wall to enjoy my last hours. I shouldn't care about this movie being bad or waste my time to write a review, but it's so lazy written and wrongly casted, it caught my attention, and this is my first ever review. I had to make an account to write this.

Please do not watch, let's keep the rating low.",1/10
"I thought it really wasn't that bad! The original music was a worthy addition to Disney (except for a couple), the queens song, hi-ho, and whistle while you work was a little bit cringey but the first 20min and the end was good I thought. I thought the dwarves were a little cursed looking but Dopey was cute and the end was cute. The way they weaved in Snow White's love I thought was done fine I guess but this movie does have some beautiful scenes (even if they are cgi), some scene are really beautiful with the lighting. Once you get past the hair, the dwarves, and some cringe parts it's a cute movie and doesn't deserve the hate everyone gives it considering all of the hard work people put into it.",8/10
"Rachel zegler is a beautifully stunning person and wonderful actress but she wasn't the best choice for snow white. The idea of what I personally seen snow white was far beyond the expectations that she isn't making but that's my view personally, Others are obviously gonna be different. The image I have of snow white was of a lady that represents everything a child sees in their mother and all the caring acts of care and motherhood that the role brings and she just wasn't fitting that for me. Oh well let's leave it to the new age of Disney creators to try and attempt to reinvent the wheel again.",4/10
"I went in hoping for magic and nostalgia, but sadly, this new Snow White lacked both. The visuals tried hard, the messaging was heavy-handed, and somewhere along the way, they forgot to make it fun. My children, usually captivated by the movie and going to the cinema, were fidgeting halfway through and resorted to running up and doen the stairs at one point (lucky we were the only one in the cinema) The pacing dragged, the humour fell flat, and the heart of the original story seemed lost in translation.

There were moments of promise, but overall it felt more like a lecture than an adventure. Disney, jeez, pull yourself together and just make family movie again please.......tnot everything needs modern reinvention sometimes, timeless charm does the job best.",3/10
"A ruined nostalgia. Not everything had to change, I don't understand why Disney sees the need to change the storyline of possibly the best story they had and absolutely potentially destroying childhoods of many. That's not the only issue, the new storyline and choice of casting was rubbish, snow white who should be the most beautiful girl in the kingdom that the evil queen envied is now uglier (my subjective opinion) than the queen. To be fair the only good thing here was the animation, pity this effort was wasted completely. I'm not even sure if I want to watch any new Disney movies, maybe just stick to the old ones.",1/10
"The overall promotion was very tempting but once halfway through the movie one realizes the poorness of the acting and what could have been a successful musical if the vibe had been more relevant.

In the bed it's a failed attempt to modernise a classic with costumes that don't resonate with the original atmosphere of the story.

What we expect snow white to worry about is neglected too often, and the signature of the studio is just not there.

Some of the photography is on point but it does not really sync with the dialogs.

I was expecting some emotional energy but it ended up feeling like a theme park parade.",2/10
"It's not Snow White, that's the definition of it. If it's the original, it means that Disney is the original, not the Disney cartoons that were made before it was the original. The script is bad, the actors are not good enough, even having the witch carry the story is not enough, it's all bad. Going to see it is also a bad experience. It feels not right. It makes you wonder what you are really watching. But the 1 star I gave is because the songs are beautiful, but not the ones the characters sing. Well, even though they sing like it's not a movie, it's a stage play. And that's what makes me define it as not Snow White, because it doesn't deserve to be called that.",1/10
"I am in no way a Disney ""Super Fan"" but I've been noticing lately that Disney recent releases are either good storylines or good music; never both. This one was unique to where it was neither. And for something the main actor Rachel Zegler claimed was this grand a new telling of Snow White, this was just a repeat of the original just with worst songs.

There has been many, MANY recreations of Snow white and I think someone needs to say it, this one is NOT the most creative.

Just because you add some new songs and make the prince into a bland robin hood does not make this a retelling and nor does that make it imaginative in the slightest.

Disney failed on multiple levels with this one. Most of the music was awful, sloppily put together, and hard to listen to. I also argue that the only songs that were good was the two they kept from the original and even then the performances were so hard to watch.

Its rare that Disney picks bad actors but Zeglar was not the best Snow white. She just seem to be there to do a job and not a good one. Zeglar seemed to be phoning in her performance especially since she has done better in the past. While on the other hand, Gal Gabot seem to be trying TOOO hard to make up for Zeglar's I don't care I just want my Disney moment attitude. Not to mention the costume designs were so forgettable, I did even release that the evil queen wore sequins and snow whites custom looked like it lost color in the wash till many people pointed it out. (at least with CINDERELLA, which was a word for word remake, we remember that jaw-droppingly beautiful ball gown and step mothers customs).

When we have gotten so many good retelling like the HUNTSMAN and MIRROR MIRROR, They seemed confused and maybe even mind-boggled about how to make this a new and exciting telling. This film so badly and desperately wanted to be different while make no real attempts. It not only confused itself, actors, and directors but the audience too. Which I want to go back to CINDERELLA, LITTLE MERMAID and THE LION KING were all successful and were all word for word remakes.

What made the original story a classic was the heart, love and simplicity of the character. Snow White herself wasn't this great or grand character but it was the magic behind her childlike wonder that everyone relates too. This just proves that just because its a famous Disney character that doesn't mean this will be a great movie. AND that sometime less can be more.",4/10
"I was hoping for the recreation of snow white instead of what we got. I shouldn't be surprised since it was only me and my date in the theater. When I saw the trailer for it initially, i thought it was such a good concept and told many people I wanted to go see it. Since I'm not one who likes spoilers for movies or reviews (it's all perspective), I've decided to see some reviews on Snow White. The Critical Drinker had the best take on it all. It seems Rachel Zegler buried herself into this and I have no idea what Disney is thinking in pushing these ideas. In a way, I am grateful that I have been exposed to to what is happening now.",1/10

"This movie had some of the worst CGI and acting I have ever witnessed. The visual effects looked like they were pulled straight from a low-budget video game from the early 2000s-characters floated awkwardly, green screen edges were painfully obvious, and every scene felt like a rushed mess of pixelated nonsense. As for the acting, I've seen more emotion in a cardboard cutout. The delivery was lifeless, the dialogue sounded forced, and not a single character felt believable. It's almost impressive how bad it was. Every scene felt like an unintentional parody. Avoid this disaster at all costs. I wouldn't recommend this even as a ""so bad it's good"" movie. It's just painful from start to finish.",1/10
"The Snow White movie is a complete disappointment. The plot is disjointed and lacks any real depth, turning a classic fairy tale into a dull and tedious affair. The performances are uninspired, dull and sluggish with the lead actress offering little emotion or charm. The CGI is excessive and overdone, distracting from any emotional connection, while the dialogue feels forced and cliché. The film attempts to modernize the story but does so in such a heavy-handed and on-the-nose manner that it feels like a hollow attempt at relevancy. A forgettable, poorly executed remake.

Whereas the original saved Disney from certain doom, this dumpster fire is just put a new nail in the coffin.",1/10
"I always try to keep an open mind when a movie gets slammed before release. Maybe the critics are overreacting, maybe there's something worthwhile beneath the negativity. But this? This is something else entirely.

Despite the massive budget and years of production, what we got feels painfully artificial. The sets look fake, the CGI animals are lifeless, and the less said about The Dwarves, the better. It's almost surreal how disconnected everything feels.

But the biggest shock? Gal Gadot. She looks stunning, but her performance is the kind that wins awards for all the wrong reasons. I never expected her to be the weakest link, yet here we are.

Even the costumes fail to impress. Snow White's outfit just doesn't work, and that hairstyle? A mystery that may never be solved.

Disney, you've turned a beloved fairytale into an unintentional parody. What happened here?",1/10
"What a mediocre attempt at distorting a timeless classic. Snow White is not Snow White, there is no prince, and the essence of the story is lost. If the intention was to promote certain ideas, they should have created an original story that aligned with the director's and producers' vision, instead of ruining this beloved classic.

The only remarkable performance comes from Gal Gadot; the rest of the cast ranges from forgettable to outright poor. But what stands out the most is the story itself - simply pathetic.

It's best not to waste your money on this remake. If you don't fall asleep halfway through, you'll be bored to death - and in some cases, you might even leave the theater angry.",1/10
"Had to turn it off halfway through just a terrible overall remake that was doomed from the start.

Between the casting and the the story just wasn't good, the main actress was very full of herself in all the interviews and I think that has also effected people's thoughts on this film Where do I even begin? This movie is not just bad-it's a cinematic trainwreck that should be studied in film schools as a cautionary tale. Every aspect of this film, from the acting to the script to the direction, feels like a masterclass in how not to make a movie. Please do not bother with this as you will regret your choice.",1/10
"I was really excited to see Snow White when I walked into the theater, thinking it'd be a nostalgic trip back to the classic tale we all know. Boy, was I wrong-this movie is something else entirely. Disney should've slapped a different title on it because it bears almost no resemblance to the Snow White we watched as kids. Honestly, it's beyond frustrating that they took such a beloved story and warped it into something unrecognizable. It feels like a dumb move to mess with the original like this-why not just make a new movie instead of distorting a classic? I'm disappointed they didn't respect what made the original so special.",1/10
"I had low expectations, but somehow, the new Snow White managed to disappoint even more than I imagined. The biggest problem? The main actress. Her performance was completely lifeless, lacking any of the charm, warmth, or grace that made the original Snow White an iconic character. Instead of a kind and whimsical princess, we get a flat, uninspired portrayal that feels more like someone begrudgingly reading lines than actually acting.

Beyond that, she seems completely miscast-there's no sense of wonder, no emotional depth, and certainly no chemistry with the rest of the cast. It's as if she was actively trying to distance herself from the role rather than embracing it. The lack of respect for the source material only makes it worse.

This movie had a chance to be a beautiful reimagining, but with such a poor lead performance, it fails at even being watchable. Disney really dropped the ball on this one.",1/10
"I will probably never understand how you can spend this much money on a movie and let someone with no talent or knowledge write a script without any supervision or redraft -_- It lacks fundamental elements of a good story, it's disjointed, chaotic and lacks any morals, values or substance. It's confused, it contradicts itself every turn.

And I'm not even touching on the remake side of this whole thing. Leaving aside that it's all a pathetic cashgrab showing how creatively bankrupt this whole industry is. They can't even recreate most basic story.

It's not even stupid funny. You can't laugh at it. It's plainly boring, disjointed and all together waste of everybody's time. Sad.",1/10
Despite the hate I really enjoy that movie bring me joy I think the story stick well to the original and bring more detail. I was scared that disney would not offerd a real fairy tale but but the kiss was there. Many person critics the dwarf but I liked them still prefer the music from original soundtrack but it's a good refresh for the younger. Feel good to see that kind of movie with all the negative in are general life. So give a chance go see that beautiful movie with a detachment of the original and you'll be probably surprised in a very good way. Good movie for a romantic time with the one you like.,8/10
"Zegler just destroyed this movie and the entire Disney legacy.

From the very beginning, this is a film that forgot its origins, its message, its childhood, its innocence, its magic that was so special about it. Perhaps the film that was Disney's big break will be the basis for the downfall of the giant that we all grew up on.

Zegler's acting is terrible, the messages she conveys, whether through the film or anywhere else, are simply sickening.

The dwarfs, who were once a significant part of the Disney symbol and who themselves symbolized the unique charm of each of them, have simply lost it completely.",1/10
"Same as you respect the elderly you have to respect the original story.

Disney now blew it and made everyone offended.

The film has no charm and feels fake.

Recommend watching the original instead!

I hope Disney will learn from this and try to understand what people want. When I was young 30 years ago Disney was combined with magic. Now charmless without any magic.

Disney also ruined my favorite dream films from the past with the new Star Wars trilogy. Same there, without Lucas it is magic and orginality. I hope someone gets replaced in Disney because someone are not doing their job.

End of not so much review of the film, sorry!",1/10
"My big gripe comes into he first few minutes of the movie, you know in the wizard of Oz where everything looked face and it clearly liked like a set, but that was ok, cos it was made back in the 50's? Well, this movie carries the same vibe. Everything looks fake and overproduced.

The acting is in no way believable at times of weakness or tenderness you have actors trying to project strength which is a total discombobulation in ebb and flow.

None of the dialogue is delivered in a way which feels authentic. The dwarves look off as well.l, they resemble character actors from wild west silver mining town reenactments.",1/10

"If you're going to change the story line, at least change the title too. This is not Snow White, not even Snow White 2025. I don't even know what I watched. What's up with the 7 dwarves being CGI? What part of this cost $250m? Not even worth $25m with this kind of CGI stuff and story line. May this flop be a warning sign for Disney to stop making these live actions of original 2D animations again. Stop ruining people's childhood going a different approach. Nobody needs that. Remaster the old movies and it would have the same success, but no you chose to produce this kind of garbage story. Let it flop.",1/10
"2025 Snow White is a prime example of why some classics should be left untouched. Stripped of the original's charm, this lifeless remake replaces heartfelt storytelling with uninspired performances, lackluster visuals, and a script that feels more like a corporate checklist than a passion project.

The CGI-heavy world lacks the magic of traditional animation, and the updated storyline, meant to be more ""modern,"" instead feels forced and uninspired. Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks warmth, and the chemistry between characters is nonexistent. Worse, the film sidelines the core themes of the original in favor of a muddled, preachy narrative that fails to resonate.

Instead of honoring a beloved classic, Disney delivers yet another soulless cash grab that no one asked for. Save your money and rewatch the 1937 masterpiece instead.",1/10
"Let's start with the most important thing:

Was going to skip this... not gonna lie... and now I regret being weak... EASILY the worst movie I've seen in years. No contest, I've seen kinder garden plays with better content than this.

DO NOT waste your money, time and brain on this, you WILL regret it, just like I do.

Let talk a little background.

I lost all interest in this movie from all the interviews with it's protagonist, but really liked the original one. SO I was really back and forward into supporting this movie. All this back and forward should've been enough to say no, and stopped myself from going.",1/10

"The movie gave me so much nostalgia from the original. It was a beautiful remastering of that original film and offers you more while still respecting that classic story. The whole movie had bright and beautiful colouring across some amazing sets. The singing was beautiful with some nice additions of songs and really creative remakes of some of the classics. I left the theatre feeling positive and humming the main song. The animation was beautiful as well with Disney also staying true to the look of the animals from the original film while also giving them new life. Overall, I really enjoyed it and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.",10/10
"To be fair I thought this movie will flop and I thought it won't be good but I didn't expect it to be this terrible, they don't didn't have to remake it. You'd think a multi-billion-dollar studio could at least make this thing look good, right? Nope. The CGI creatures look straight out of a low-budget Cats (2019) reboot, the green screen work is distractingly obvious, and the cinematography makes it painfully clear that this was shot entirely on a soundstage. Say what you will about the 1937 animation, but at least it had soul. Disney's Snow White (2025) is what happens when a classic fairytale gets dragged through a corporate diversity seminar and comes out soulless. I recommend you to save your money for something more valuable and precious.",1/10
"Honestly a terrible remake, destroying everything that was to love about the Disney Classic. It does no justice to the actual storyline. So sad to see a live action remake of one my favorite movies from my childhood be a complete bomb. Never would I have thought I would see the day where I actually am in favor of the villain in a Disney Story. Hope to see them try and redeem themselves someway by a different remake, with a few new cast members. Do yourselves a favor and take your family to watch literally anything else instead of wasting your time on this one. This movie honestly 1000/10 was not worth the money to see it.",1/10
"Of all the Disney animated classics, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" might just be the least necessary one to remake. It's the most iconic, yet ironically, the one with the weakest emotional connection to modern audiences.

The original 1937 animated film is so old that most people either don't remember the actual plot or have never bothered to watch it at all. For most, ""Snow White"" lives on as vague cultural shorthand - a poisoned apple, a magic mirror, ""Hi Ho,"" and that's about it. Unlike the Disney Renaissance films (Aladdin, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast), which still have songs people sing in the shower, ""Snow White's"" music barely registers anymore. It's a relic.

Another reason this remake felt unnecessary is Disney's self-imposed creative straitjacket. When Disney remakes ""Snow White"", they're not reimagining the classic fairy tale. They're remaking ""their own version"" of the story.

This gives Disney a competitive advantage but also creates a significant handicap. The advantage? Disney's animated ""Snow White"" is so culturally dominant that people often mistakenly think they invented the tale. This monopoly on the cultural memory of ""Snow White"" gives Disney an unparalleled level of brand loyalty - other studios can release ""their"" versions of ""Snow White"", but they'll just feel like ""yet another ""Snow White"" movie."" When Disney does it, it's ""The"" ""Snow White"" movie. It's an event. You don't want to ignore it.

The disadvantage? Disney can't stray too far from their original animated film. They ""have"" to keep the look and feel of their version intact to preserve their cultural dominance. Reinventing the wheel would risk alienating fans who expect the movie to ""feel like Disney."" So instead of daring, bold reimaginings like ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"" (a horror take), ""Mirror Mirror"" (a campy comedy), or ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (dark action fantasy), Disney gives us a watered-down rehash that feels as bland as it is redundant.

It's clear Disney believed that the only way to turn ""Snow White"" into another billion-dollar juggernaut was to stick to the formula. After all, it worked for ""The Lion King"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""Aladdin"". Why mess with success? Those previous remakes were soulless cash grabs too, but they made money, so Disney stuck to the plan.

Unfortunately, they didn't anticipate that their one bold casting choice - the decision to feature a Latina actress as Snow White - would blow up so spectacularly in their faces.

Disney's live-action strategy relies heavily on nostalgia, but it's nostalgia dressed up in shiny packaging. The studio markets these movies as comforting throwbacks with just enough tweaks to feel ""fresh."" But in reality, these tweaks are often superficial, half-hearted, and inconsistent. ""Snow White"" is no exception.

The film is filled with Disney's usual sins: slavish devotion to the animated original (to the point of absurdity), awkward attempts to modernize certain aspects of the story, and an overall lack of creativity. The result is a movie that feels like it's trying to justify its own existence and failing miserably.

Take the visuals, for instance. Disney insists on preserving the look of the original film, but without any thought as to ""Why"" these design choices made sense in the first place. The costumes and set design feel less like ""classic fairy tale"" and more like ""theme park cosplay."" By comparison, ""Mirror Mirror's"" whimsical costumes fit the film's comedic tone, and ""Snow White and the Huntsman's"" gritty aesthetic matched its dark, action-packed vibe. Disney's live-action ""Snow White"", on the other hand, feels like it only exists to sell merchandise.

The story fares no better. Disney knows it needs to flesh out the characters and make their relationships more believable, but it never fully commits to these changes. For example, the Evil Queen's jealousy of Snow White is still mostly about beauty, with only a vague suggestion of political ambition. Meanwhile, the Huntsman's moral dilemma about killing Snow White is staged so awkwardly that it feels like a bad high school play. The actors do their best, but the scene is so stilted and out of place that it's almost painful to watch.

Perhaps the most glaring issue is the Evil Queen herself. Gal Gadot is, without question, the worst Evil Queen in cinematic history. And no, I'm not exaggerating. Let's be real: the only reason she was cast is because of her looks. Sure, she's gorgeous, but when you're following in the footsteps of Sigourney Weaver (Snow White: A Tale of Terror), Julia Roberts (Mirror Mirror), and Charlize Theron (Snow White and the Huntsman), looking pretty isn't enough. Those actresses brought elegance, menace, and depth to the role. Gadot? She brought... eyebrow wiggling and ""constipated villain face."" Every time she tried to emote, I felt secondhand embarrassment. Her singing? Let's just say it sounded so autotuned, I wasn't sure if it was even her voice.

To be fair, this is probably her least embarrassing performance since ""Wonder Woman 1984"". At least she managed to hit the basic beats of ""scheming and evil,"" even if it felt like she'd just learned the concept from an acting coach five minutes before filming. But honestly, Disney could've thrown a dart at a list of actresses, and anyone it hit would've been better than Gadot.

On the flip side, Rachel Zegler - the controversial choice for Snow White - is the film's one saving grace. Hate her all you want, but the girl can act, sing, and dance circles around anyone else in this movie. Her performance is effortlessly charismatic, with a radiant charm that lights up every scene she's in. You can criticize her all you want on Twitter, but her talent is undeniable. There's a reason industry legends like Rita Moreno have called her a ""triple threat"" - she's the real deal.

Zegler's musical numbers in this film are mesmerizing. She knows how to act through a song, weaving emotion into every note and gesture. Even her much-mocked expressions during ""Waiting on a Wish"" (yes, I've seen the memes) are a masterclass in theatricality. If you went into this movie determined to hate her, that's on you. But if you're willing to set aside the internet hate train for a moment, you might actually see why she's one of the most exciting young talents in Hollywood.

At the end of the day, Disney's live-action ""Snow White"" is exactly what you'd expect: a mediocre cash grab with a few fleeting moments of brilliance (courtesy of Zegler). It's not the worst thing Disney's ever made, but it's certainly not worth the hype. For me, it's just another soulless remake that exists more to sell toys than to tell a compelling story.

If you loved Disney's ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"" remakes, you might enjoy this one too. But if you're tired of Disney serving up reheated leftovers and calling it a feast, you're better off skipping this one.",3/10
"Three stars solely for Gal Gadot. She is stunning and does the Disney-baddie acting perfectly: corny lines, dance number and all.

The casting of Snow White is a disaster. Rather than tall, fair, graceful and beautiful we get this person that is really bland. Not too be mean but she is just clearly not suitable for the role.

The feigned warmth just comes across as annoying and tedious. And of course the romance is gone - replace by some idea that Snow White is to be a leader of the kingdom and queen.

It is all too predictable and just sad to see. Why do we have to stand with these ""modern"" approaches to classical tales. Stop butchering the classics.",3/10
"This movie feels like a 1-hour-and-49-minute SNL skit that forgot to end after the first punchline. I went in with an open mind-really, I did-but by the time the credits rolled, I was left wondering who greenlit this and why they thought it was a good idea to stretch a sketch into a feature film.

The whole thing starts off with a vibe that's trying way too hard to be clever. You've got Snow White, reimagined as this edgy, modern heroine who's more about snarky one-liners than anything resembling the fairy tale we know.

It's like they handed the script to a room full of improv comics.

The dialogue's packed with pop culture jabs and self-aware winks that might've landed if they'd kept it short and sweet. But at nearly two hours? It's exhausting.

The dwarves, for example, are less characters and more walking punchlines, each one a caricature that feels ripped from a late-night parody.

The songs are catchy for about ten seconds before you realize they're just there to pad the runtime.

I get it-they wanted to flip the script, make it fresh, appeal to a new crowd. But there's a difference between reinventing a classic and turning it into a gag.

Like an SNL bit that's funny for five minutes but keeps dragging on until you're begging for the host to cut to commercial.

Look, if you're expecting a heartfelt story or even a solid satire, you're out of luck. Snow White 2025 is a marathon of smirks that forgets fairy tales are supposed to have a little magic, not just a laugh track.

I'd give it a pass unless you've got time to kill and a soft spot for overstretched comedy.",1/10
"Let's start with Snow White herself. Her character is not only unlikable but also deeply confusing. Her facial expressions when she sings are so bizarre that it's impossible to tell if she's angry, happy, or sad she shifts between emotions every two seconds like she's glitching. Instead of embodying a graceful and kind-hearted princess, she comes across as bossy and frustrating, making it difficult to root for her at all.

Then there are the Seven Dwarfs except, well, they aren't even real. The decision to make them CGI was questionable from the start, but the final result is worse than expected. They look unnatural, lifeless, and completely out of place in the film. The scenes set in their home are particularly painful to watch, especially when Snow White, instead of helping or showing any appreciation, literally orders them to clean the house. What happened to the warmth and friendship in this story?

And, of course, the film follows the now all-too-predictable trend of removing any meaningful romance. While there's nothing wrong with updating themes, the way it's handled here feels forced and empty. Snow White's journey doesn't feel empowering it just feels directionless and, honestly, boring.

Overall, Snow White is a disaster. The visuals are unappealing, the characters lack any heart, and the story strips away everything that made the original special. It's a soulless, frustrating experience that fails both as a remake and as a standalone film. A Hollow and Confusing Reimagining.",1/10
"I went in with an unbias mind knowing liberties and differences would be taken, but the story had holes, the CGI was terrible, and the ending just ""happened."" My kids even walked out disappointed saying ""that's not how it happened"" and the dwarfs looked weird and fake. The prince's role was an after thought and I believe was just there to connect to two movies, but nothing more. In the original, the way the dwarfs came to Snow White's aid regarding the evil queen added suspence and better connected the relationship between the two, however that connection was lost here. The evil queen was very one dimentional and didn't have much to work within the script. The singing and songs were ok for the movie's sake though.",2/10
"The original Snow White is a perfect and timeless movie. It is still enjoyable and funny even now.

This remake is terrible. Everything is obviously fake and there is nothing magical about Snow White talking to bad CGI dwarves and animals. The changes to the story were cliche and weak.

Some strong points were when the wicked queen appeared as an old hag to give Snow White the poison apple and she fell and the apple rolled from her hand. That is a direct scene from the original. The ""hag"" and apple were great and the fall was great photography. But again, why is it needed? We don't need to recreate something in attempt to match it's cinematic perfection from earlier.

This was one of the first movies I've ever left the theater early. Didn't see the ending and from the reviews it sounds like it didn't make it better.",2/10
"Wanted to love this movie but Gal Gadot's atrociously monotone, dead acting ruined yet another film. Not sure how she was casted for this role, as all of her previous films were also extremely hard to watch. Perhaps, Disney should wait a few years and try again with someone better. Guessing Hollywood stars are not given out for great actors but just for being famous? The actress who played Snow White, Rachel Zegler, played her part beautifully. I would watch her in another movie. As a lifelong fan of all things Disney this was a massive disappointment. I hope this a learning lesson for Disney that the actors who play these iconic should embody the role fully.",1/10
"Not for oldest public, which came on purpose to live again the magic. Neither for the youngest, which will follow different role models than girl gets a sword followed by cgi Friends.

Better focus on other family friendly movies that covers more subjects than disney, gender is a subject that us when we where kids didnt event care. They need to define themselves in this new era and stay away from trends.

If you cant make it better, make something new.

Besides that nothing new about actors and actresses. Gal gadot will fall to oblivion because cant act and well sniw white, same fate as the mermaid.",1/10
"What a wreck of a movie. The whole cast was uninspired and it looked like some amateurs put together this movie. No compelling story, no worthy performances, no set design. Just an overall terrible movie.

The characters are not only bland but also have this weird unconvincing ability. As if you could almost hear the real 21st century people playing those parts. I could literally imagine these dudes going grocery and paying their bills instead of being a part of this magical fantasy world. The number of empty seats in the cinema didn't inspire confidence but regardless, I gave it a shot.

Skip this one.",2/10
"I'm sorry but what was Disney thinking? Movie feels rushed and doesn't build characters. Gained no emotional attachment to any of the characters except Dopey.

Normally these Disney musicals would bring me to tears in at least 1 or 2 scenes but I felt nothing and left wanting more. Was just horrible. The Evil Queen has nothing to envy about Snow White since she is the fairest of them all in my book.

Awful! Just bad story telling on the second half of the movie. No excitement, no true heroic scenes, nothing to teach, just a bland narrative that ended too quickly and left no joy, no tears, no emotions to the viewer.",2/10
"Honestly I can look past Rachel Ziegler but gal gadot acting??? How is she still booked!! She make the whole movie worst than it is. I do admit Rachel can definitely sing but it missing the element of being graceful sweet for snowhite. For the world telling women to be strong and powerful sometimes as a girl myself I want to be reminded that we can be soft graceful and feminine just like the original snowhite, I really wish this live action keeps the femininity but oh wells. The hate should be given to Gal Gadot.

Costumes wise it can definitely be better snowhite outfit looks cheap like it been bought from SHEIN.",1/10
"Snow White remake set out to modernize the classic fairy tale, but it ultimately leaves audiences disappointed. The film fails to stay true to the original story while also struggling to establish its own identity.

First and foremost, the lifeless script is a major issue. The characters lack depth, the dialogues feel artificial, and there's no emotional connection with the audience. Key elements of the fairy tale have been altered, but rather than making the story more engaging, these changes strip it of its essence.

The performances aren't particularly impressive either. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks charisma and inspiration, making the character feel ordinary and at times even unlikable. Additionally, the characters replacing the seven dwarfs are weakly designed and serve no meaningful purpose in the story.

When it comes to visuals and production quality, the film is shockingly mediocre for a Disney production. The CGI looks cheap, backgrounds feel artificial, and instead of creating a magical atmosphere, the movie ends up looking dull and uninspired.",1/10
"I am unclear on what Disney's motives behind this movie. I have watched different iterations of Snow white and by far this is the worst. The lead actress lacks the essence of snow white, the gentleness, warmth, loveliness of snow white was terribly portrayed. The positives in the music presentation, in which the lead actress looked strong, and supposed message of ' girls are brave', were heavily overshadowed by terrible acting in general, script, CGI, support characters and more.

The whole film is just really uninspiring, cringeworthy at best. Me and my colleagues unanimously agreed this might worst remake of any classic that we have watched in our lifetime.",3/10
"This was actually an amazing version of Snow White, kept the essence of the original whilst not making snow a damsel in distress. Stop being so nostalgic people. It was great.

The dwarfs were CGI, I get it but it really wasn't that bad. Dopey was an absolutely wonderful character and the way Rachel Ziegler was able to interact with them must have been quite difficult.

They also explained why Snow White became Snow White without using the rhyme which worked.

Gal Cadot was also a great evil queen.

Overall the acting was great, the story was great and it took nothing away from the original whatsoever.",10/10
"Could not find the motivation to sit through and watch even the first 15 minutes of the movie. The acting itself was terrible and scripts seem so forced and out of context. Disney has continued to prove that live-action remakes of classic animated tales are getting tiresome and unoriginal. Besides The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon remake being pretty good, the other remakes have remained dull, baffling, or offensive. Snow White is one of those dull ones. Covered with excessive usages of CGI and colors, the camerawork, production style and colors feel bloated and unsocial. Alongside with the bland direction, uninteresting takes of how they tell the tale and where the characters were once beloved in the animated movie, becomes lifeless and uninteresting here.

Disney please do better your focus seems to be not making good movies but something else...",1/10
"I'm seriously getting tired of these Disney remakes. Just like mostly every other Disney remake, this movie has no reason to exist. Now, to be fair, the movie was definitely not as horrible as I expected, but still, it's definitely not good. But there was one good thing about this movie, and that's of course Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White. Her performance was shockingly good, but sadly, even with how good she was, that doesn't save the movie. The animals don't look bad, but the dwarfs look horrible, and I don't even need to explain why they look bad. You'll instantly understand what I'm saying once you see them for yourself. Anyway, I don't really feel like writing that long of a review for this movie in particular, so I guess that's it for my review. The movie isn't horrible, but it's still bad, but I could see children enjoying this, so at least there's that.",4/10

"LIKES: Animation For Animals Costume/Makeup Some Dialogue Well-Written/Delivered Some Good Emotional Moments Musical Level Songs Cute/Cuddly/Disney Modern Voice Acting Is Good For Me Solid Messages.

Summary: Despite the masses calling for the head of Snow White, I found a few things I think were done well in this film. We start with the voice acting and the cast that brings it to life when it comes to the dwarves and the magic mirror. Though not as strong as the original seven, I liked the new group very much and found their techniques quite fitting for the live-action make. They embody the personalities well and add that fantasy element Disney is very efficient at making but still holds more emotion than much of the non-digital cast. These guys are the ones who deliver some of the better dialogue, a few of the live-action cast managed to drop some really powerful lines at just the right moment that will make it on the quote boards. I found those quotes often in those very heartfelt moments where everything came together, some inflections of the Disney magic sparkling the way they did in the 1900s and delivering those solid messages of kindness, fairness, and hard work to solve problems.

Where most of the splendor came for me in the movie is the visual effects that capture that Disney cuddliness we know the company for holding. The costumes and makeup are solid rebuilds of the cartoon design, many of them authentic nods to the times but pop with a bit of modern sheen for future cosplays. Sure, some of the costumes look a little cheaper than others, but overall, it is a better portrayal of the character than other facets. I enjoyed the songs to some degree, with a very Broadway musical ambiance radiating from them as Snow sings her way through the opening numbers and dances about with the town in new songs that Disney continues to spin out. The older numbers are very fun as well, not quite as Mystical Melody as in the past, but still holding that fun charm that I remember from the film, but could have used some more finesse and planning to be memorable. Finally, the animation for the animals was something I found to be my favorite aspect of this movie. Like Enchanted, Snow White's live adaptation puts a lot of gorgeous detail into the animals, keeping much of their physiology with just a touch of the human element to add that adorable energy to give them their own tertiary personalities. They play a rather large part in the movie, and it helps add Disney family-friendly charm for the younger audience members that modern Disney continues to keep in their films and should be enjoyable to the masses.

DISLIKES Plot Is Messy Too Many Characters CGI Design Is Meh for Most Wasted Wicked Queen Boring/Lacking Stakes The Dance Numbers Are All The Same Unnecessary Musicals Lacking Full Punch Conflicting Story Arcs Predictable/Tries Too Hard One Of The Weakest Climactic Endings A Victim of Edits and Media Summary: That's where the likes end, unfortunately. Snow White's live remake comes with several dislikes that I feel are going to be ill-received by audiences, given what I saw. One of the biggest weaknesses for me was the new plot. Sure, the origin of her name is a bit eye-rolling, but Snow White's new tale is trying to be too many things at once and do too many arcs in a compressed time. Snow White's desire to get outside the castle is not such a simple tale as we are introduced to bandits, dwarves, more of huntsmen, evil queens, and new desires for the protagonist. The film is loaded with way too many characters, and I don't really have time to learn most of their names or stories before jumping back into another facet of this movie. The writers struggled to pick lanes and stay in them, and their plot intertwining is very messy and knotted up with frayed transitions. I found it difficult to get tied to any of the characters, none of them packing that same punch outside a few moments nor as well-layered as I know Disney can do. Even the Wicked Queen is very wasted, an antagonist with such potential drowned out by awkward plots and too many arcs competing for dominance. Yet, the worst thing is Snow White's character is too spread thin between the different ""princesses"" she has to be. This new age of remaking the character but keeping to the classic got out of hand, Zegler doing her best to play so many approaches not enough to make this a very inconsistent Snow White I didn't love or hate. When you see that a lot of the live-character actors didn't have the best acting consistency, it only further weakens the strained characters for viewers like me and makes the film boring.

Surely, the spectacle is enough to make up for it, right? I'm sorry to say the answer is no on that one. The dance numbers are charming at times, that musical prowess present in the resonating voices, thundering instruments, and grandiose extensions of notes. However, many of the songs feel very much the same, with reprises and similar-sounding tunes that lack the variety I know Disney to have past their earlier works. The dance numbers also felt very carbon-copy, the same twirls, exchanges, and steps feeling lazy and repetitive shots that pale in comparison to shows like Wicked do so well. Even worse, the movie felt very carefree, where they inserted songs, with many of them feeling shoehorned in to get another track on the playlist. Such haphazard planning doesn't do much for me, especially when each track feels very much the same song. As for the action, this is another Snow White tale that struggles to do much with the action scenes or climatic struggles. This remake makes a show for building up drama, adding suspense with potentially losing characters at any moment before changing their mind. It's a rather safe film, with more marching and shadow work than actual action, making this feel like the second season of House of Dragons. While this is good news for parents who think any conflict is too violent, for those who like more meat to their story, you'll be subjected to some of the most anticlimactic resolutions to the story. A great theme to stick with regarding the messages, but as a spectacle, it is kind of dull in the grand scheme of Disney movies. All of these problems, I think, are due to the media coverage and the edits that came from it taking the changes too far to make a cohesive film.

The VERDICT: I can see the potential of Snow White and some of the modern elements that could have worked. Disney continues to make good visuals and world-crafting tricks, supplies Broadway-like bellows in their tracks, good voice acting for some lines, and plenty of the new cute and cuddly magic that Disney has played well with their stories. That component will make this movie enjoyable for many families to see, especially those with younger children. However, in terms of a cohesive piece, this live-action fails on many levels with its approach to trying too many things in one film. The conflicting nature of Snow White between classic and new was not fun, nor was trying to juggle many characters who weren't necessary and could have spent more time with the dwarves. Much of the acting could do little to save bland characters who had little time to enjoy, and I was bored with the predictable and anticlimactic tales that couldn't get away from the messages. Throw in repetitive song and dance numbers, and you leave me little of that fantastic factor Disney's 2-D animation was known for having. Thus, is this movie a necessity for theater viewing? I don't think it is outside of a field trip or group outing, with your time much better spent watching at home. When I factor in everything, I give Snow White:

Adventure/Family/Musical/Fantasy/Romance: 5.5-6.0 Movie Overall: 4.5-5.0.",5/10

"Can Disney make a redo with a better casting please? I love the Disney princesses but ever since the real life little mermaid it has been a down hill. Can Disney do a better job at casting? The outfits did not look like they were for a Disney movie more like a play for the theatre type of outfits. And oh my god they forgot to put Snowwhites bow on her head. The dwarfs did not look like the dwarfs. I just couldn't, I am so heartbroken because the originals are so good and they're ruining it. Either don't make remakes or live up to it and keep the same story line as the original please. Cast actors that look like the ORIGINAL movies please. So disappointed.",1/10
"The new Snow White movie is a disappointing attempt at modernizing a classic. The storytelling feels uninspired, with weak character development and lackluster dialogue. The visuals, while polished, lack the charm and magic of the original. The film's message feels forced rather than organically woven into the narrative. Worse, the pacing drags, making it hard to stay engaged. Even the performances fail to impress, with the lead lacking the charisma needed for such an iconic role. Overall, it's a forgettable, unnecessary remake.

I would highly recommend anyone that wants to watch it to save their money.",1/10
"Snow White (2025) A reimagining of Disney's fairy tale into a live-action version filled with vision and a modern perspective, while firmly retaining the framework of the original Grimm fairy tale.

The storytelling focuses on the development of the main characters, particularly Snow White and the Evil Queen, giving them greater depth than the original. While preserving the romantic and dreamy essence of a fairy tale, it cleverly incorporates elements of power struggles and personal identity.

Rachel Zegler plays Snow White with a beautiful voice and strong performance, portraying a character who embodies both gentleness and resilience.

Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen exudes allure and cruelty, delivering a chilling performance that leaves an impression. However, her role lacks the intensity it deserves, missing the fearfulness and mystique expected from the character.

The visuals are crafted with stunning beauty and imagination, reflecting the essence of a fairy tale. The fantasy world is breathtaking, with vibrant colors and intricate details, especially in the forest scenes and lively animals.

The soundtrack remains a highlight of Disney. The music seamlessly blends classic songs with new melodies, particularly the standout track ""Waiting on a Wish."" The classic ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" is reimagined in a modern, melodious way.

However, the screenplay has noticeable weaknesses. Some parts of the story lack deep emotional pull, and supporting characters are underdeveloped. The seven dwarfs are adorable but have overly limited roles.

The first half of the film captivates with its visuals and emotions, but the second half loses balance with rushed pacing. The ending feels overly simplistic, leaving a sense of disappointment.

Snow White (2025) blends classic elements with contemporary flair and a fresh interpretation in a satisfying way. It may not reach its full potential, but it's a film that both fans of the classic and newer audiences can enjoy.

Score: 9/10 Despite initial negative opinions about Rachel Zegler, after watching the film, I must admit her acting and singing skills are impressive.

Andrew Burnap as Jonathan 😍 is absolutely adorable! Those tight pants are perfection-he's so charming!

The scenes with the animals and dwarfs are incredibly realistic and wonderfully done-I loved them.",10/10
"This is a complete waste of time. Don't bother to watch this mess. It makes a mockery of the classic story people loved. The lead actress has a good voice, but is totally unsuited to this part. I don't know how this company can stray so far from what created success. It has no redeeming qualities that would justify taking any child to see it. It would simply create an unpleasant memory. Children should be exposed to positive, enjoyable experiences that contribute to a happy childhood. This is the opposite of such an experience. Hopefully, it will lose Disney so much money that they will have to return to Walt's original desire to entertain the public.",1/10

"This live-action Snow White remake is a cursed goblet of a film that even the Evil Queen wouldn't bother poisoning. It's a mess so grim, you'd think the Brothers Grimm came back just to file a restraining order. Rachel Zegler's Snow White is less ""whistle while you work"" and more ""scream into the void,"" delivering lines like she's reading a self-help book to a coma patient. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen slinks around with all the menace of a mall goth on a smoke break, trying to menacingly overact her way out of a script that's dumber than a bag of enchanted hammers. The dwarfs? Poof-gone! Replaced by a troupe of ""unique helpers"" so forgettable they're basically the human equivalent of IKEA furniture instructions. The CGI looks like someone spilled glitter on a Windows 98 screensaver, and the plot trudges along like a donkey cart stuck in mud. This remake's so bad, even the glass coffin would rather stay empty than dignify it. Zero stars-watch it only if you hate joy and love punishing yourself more than the huntsman hates cardio.",1/10

"The money lost can be earned again but the time wasted watching this can never be replaced. I don't understand what was wrong with the first one and why Disney needed to do this terrible remake. The original was and is a masterpiece. This remake is complete trash compared to it. In fact, I can't think of sny remake that I actually like but this is by the worst ever! Please stop doing dumb things Disney. You once were a great company! If you keep making garbage like this I'm scared Disney will be lost forever. Please correct your business before this happens. We don't need to see such garbage as this....",1/10
"Only watched because my date insisted. I haven't gone to the movies in a long time and haven't been this bored and dreaded for a movie to be over in ever.

Do not do not see this lol unless you want to hate your time at the theater, it's not worth the happy ending your date will give you lol. The movie was paced horribly. The actors were subpar. What happened to these movies? When I was a kid these movies gave you hope, interest and was something you'd remember for the better.

All I can say is the main character didn't play this role well. Then later I look online and see she's an arrogant person and it makes sense to why the character didn't connect with me. Snow White is not like that.",1/10
"I am genuinely writing a letter to the cinema to ask for a free ticket to another movie. I walked out of this garbage mid-movie and the staff informed me how to get a free replacement ticket. Who on earth thought this movie was a good idea? It's just a rambling mess. Scenes don't match, she asks for help but then does everything herself. This is NOT Snow White. Did the writer or director even read the book? Or watch the original? Save your money, buy some gas and drive as far away from this movie as you can. Gal Gadot is still super hot though and she is the only reason I went to see this. Please Hollywood, don't blame her for this nightmare.",1/10
"""This movie was a disappointment for those who grew up with the original. The classic Snow White enchanted us with its unforgettable songs, lovable characters, and pure, timeless magic-elements this reboot struggles to recapture. Rather than embracing the fairy tale's essence, it pivots to modern clichés, diluting the heart that made the 1937 film a cherished gem. Stunning visuals can't compensate for a story that feels hollow, leaving fans yearning for the dwarves' cheerful tune and Snow's tender spirit. It's an ambitious try, but for many, it falls short of the original's enduring charm maybe future projects will learn.",1/10
"Snow White! Omg I just found out this was going to release like a week ago. I had to go get my tickets right away. Made it in for the premiere! Though I am a male, I remember watching the Disney princess movies as a child with my family. Seeing the live action is a must. I was also very excited to see Gal Gadot starred in it as I have enjoyed her roles in the Fast and Furious franchise and Marvel. Her role in this movie is different, seeing her play the villain is a little awkward lol. The movie itself has a feel as if augmented reality was mixed with a play. It is absolutely wonderful. Seeing it on the big screen with the family is a must. Especially for Disney fans!",10/10
"Disney destroyed a masterpiece. This new *Snow White* starring Rachel Zegler is a hollow, joyless mess that spits on the legacy of the original. I sat down with my two kids to watch it - they love the classic - and they were bored, confused, and begging to turn it off. That never happened with the 1937 version.

Zegler's Snow White has zero charm. She's unlikable, and nothing like the kind-hearted character generations grew up with.

It's not a reimagining - it's a demolition. They didn't update a classic, they wrecked it. Disney should be ashamed. If you want magic, watch the original. This version is a lifeless, preachy waste of time.",1/10
"Disney back it at it again ruining the movies that made them beloved/famous in the first place. I swear at this point they're doing it on purpose for a tax write off or something. My mind is completely boggled that this was actually written, filmed, edited, screened, and STILL somehow made it into public circulation. Anyways enough said, there's very little to even begin with. I just don't understand why they can't just keep their legacy alone because those films are timeless, these adaptations get thrown in the garbage bin before they're even off the terrible live action movie assembly line..",1/10
"This movie makes no sense. It is a complete disaster. My 4 and 5-year-old was so upset because the cartoons she watched did not look the same in the film. Disney did not work on the script, horrible actor. This movie has everything wrong with modern cinema. The lead actress has no charisma and is not talented to work on classics like Snow White. The screenplay is poor and filibustering. I highly recommend not watching this movie, it is indeed a big disappointment. Disney needs to change its leadership and must remember who the core audience is. If the parents don't like it, then the kids don't like it either.",1/10
"Please do NOT waste your time watching this joke of a movie.

First of all the story is changed up so much for NO reason snow white has always been a love story about the prince and snow white.

Now they made it extremely cringy with horrible singing and no love story what so ever.

The CGI looks absolutely horrible, the acting is terrible, and the singing dont even get me started on that ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS.

If you still decide to watch this movie just get ready to waste hour of ur life and never get that time back.

One of the worst movies ever made hands down and i hope they never produce anything like this ever again.",1/10
"Cannot recommend. Even to my child to enjoy. It just wasn't the magical Disney experience we all expect. The original snow white that was released had more love, more passion, more character to it. Simply put the outfit choice on the new snow white movie in NO way represents the original movie. Colors, design, all of it was mostly inaccurate. Second point, the ending of the movie was quite litterally the most POORLY written ending i have EVER seen. Like Disney come on?.... YOU CAN DO BETTER. We trusted you to remake this film in the proper way and you absolutely BUTCHERED it. I will not recommend....",1/10
"Disney's latest live-action adaptation of ""Snow White"" is a disheartening misstep that fails to capture the magic of the original classic. The film is marred by subpar performances, a lackluster narrative, and misguided directorial choices, making it an experience many viewers might wish to forget.

Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks the depth and charm necessary to engage audiences. Her performance feels superficial, leaving the character devoid of the innocence and warmth that endeared her to generations. Similarly, Gal Gadot's attempt at the Evil Queen is disappointingly one-dimensional. Her over-the-top delivery transforms a potentially menacing antagonist into a caricature, stripping away any semblance of genuine threat. Critics have noted her overacting and lack of depth compared to previous portrayals of the Queen.

The storyline is a convoluted mess, straying far from the original narrative without offering any meaningful innovation. The plot's attempt to modernize the tale results in a disjointed and uninspired script that fails to resonate. The film's modernization efforts lack the appeal of the original, leaving audiences yearning for the timeless simplicity of the 1937 version.

Director Marc Webb's vision for this remake is bewildering. The film oscillates between tones, unable to decide whether it wants to honor its source material or subvert it. This indecisiveness results in a jarring viewing experience that lacks cohesion. The narrative introduces complex new subplots but fails to maintain a consistent tone, preventing the movie from delivering a unified and impactful retelling of the classic tale.

The production's shortcomings are so pronounced that the pre-film advertisements provided more entertainment than the feature itself. The desire to request a refund is understandable, as the film offers little to justify the price of admission. It's a regrettable addition to Disney's live-action repertoire, serving as a cautionary example of how not to reimagine a beloved story.",1/10
"Disney's live-action Snow White is proof that not every classic needs a remake. From the very start, the film feels like it's trying too hard to distance itself from the beloved 1937 original stripping away its charm, heart, and timeless magic in favour of a forced modern message that falls flat.

Rachel Zegler's performance lacks the warmth and wonder you'd expect from Snow White, and her dismissive attitude toward the original film in interviews only makes it harder to connect with her portrayal. The visuals, while polished, feel uninspired, and the replacement of the Seven Dwarfs with a mismatched group of CGI-enhanced characters just adds to the film's identity crisis.

Even my daughters, who usually love Disney films, wanted to leave halfway through. When a movie fails to captivate its target audience children it's clear something went very wrong.

Disney had the opportunity to honor a classic while introducing it to a new generation, but instead, they delivered a soulless, forgettable mess. Snow White 2025 isn't just a disappointment it's a warning sign that maybe, just maybe, not every story needs to be rewritten.",1/10
"I honestly can't believe how disappointing this movie was. As a fan of the classic Snow White story, I had high hopes, but this remake is a complete letdown. The plot is messy and lacks the charm that made the original so timeless. It feels like the filmmakers tried way too hard to make it ""modern"" but ended up stripping away the magic and heart of the story.

The pacing is all over the place, and there's just no real emotional depth. The performances are flat, especially the lead actress, who feels more like a cardboard cutout than a relatable character.

The ""updates"" to the story are just unnecessary changes that don't add anything valuable. The movie feels more like a cash grab than a heartfelt reimagining, and it doesn't bring anything fresh or exciting to the table.

Honestly, don't waste your money on this one. It's not worth the ticket price or the time. Stick to the original, or better yet, skip it entirely.",1/10
"I really enjoyed it. I thought the music was really good and every single shot was visually stunning. A really beautiful movie. I saw it in IMAX and the animation was really well done and fluid. The characters had so much emotion. It was a very nostalgic movie, retelling an old story with updated technology while still nodding to iconic pieces of the original film and the characters in it. I found myself connecting with unsuspecting characters and being provoked by their reactions to the plot. Parts of it were fun loving, light and silly in a good way, while other parts were more serious with strong emotion. Overalls well balanced and enjoyable for the whole family.",10/10
"If you enjoy laughter, suspense, love, drama, or any feel-good feeling. Do not watch this movie. This IS the worst movie of all time. Who ever the actress is, almost ruined all of Disney for me. Horrible acting is an understatement. I will never watch a movie she's in just because of how terrible she was in this. Watching paint dry or concrete harden will bring you more joy and content than this movie will. The CGI was horrendous, and the storyline made zero sense. There was a point in time during the movie where I thought I was dreaming because there is absolutely no way someone saw this and thought that there was another human on earth that would enjoy it. If you enjoy breathing air, you will not enjoy this movie. Please, spare yourself, you will be much happier in life by never watching this movie. I wouldn't even wish this on my worse enemy.",1/10
"I fell asleep 3 times. I don't understand why would anyone want to watch this. They only thing I can almost said it was ""well made"" were the costumes. But the dwarfs were also so horrible and not realistic and they were trying to make them realistic. Idk it's just a bad very bad movie, the music is also very bad and that girl has the exact same voice as ALL THE OTHER DISNEY PRINCESSES. They should start casting different voices, it's boring and absurd how everyone sounds exactly the same. I wouldn't watch this even if it was free. Terrible movie, if I could give it a 0 I would! But here it. Goes my 1. Very deserved.",1/10
"In short YES. Long form still yes even though I had written the movie off last year I still watched it like every other Disney movie cause childhood vibes it was supposed to be a feel good movie but at every turn it felt like the writers made the wrong decision even casting the movie properly could have done wonders for the film truly sad to see such a respected brand throw itself in the garbage by choice it reminds me a lot of the Dallas Mavericks the owners trying to make money back on their investments making ""bold moves"" just to sit back thinking they got it figured out when in reality now no one wants to watch your product even if they were forced to.",1/10
"The new Snow White is an absolute travesty, a cinematic dumpster fire that torches the charm of the original. The plot stumbles like a drunken dwarf, with dialogue so wooden it could rebuild the Evil Queen's castle. The CGI looks like it was rendered on a calculator, and the reimagined characters are insufferable-Snow White's now a smug, girl-boss caricature, while the dwarves are reduced to cringe-worthy stereotypes. The songs? Ear-bleeding garbage that'll make you beg for the poison apple. Save your time and money-this remake deserves to be buried in the deepest forest. Honestly, even the mirror would say it's the ugliest of them all.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is yet another lifeless live-action remake that fails to capture the magic of the original. The heartwarming story and iconic characters have been replaced with dull performances, forced modern changes, and uninspired visuals. Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the charm and innocence that made the character beloved, while Gal Gadot's Evil Queen feels more like a caricature than a true villain. The CGI is mediocre, the songs are forgettable, and the film ultimately feels pointless.

Even the production design, which should have been a highlight, feels bland and artificial. The charm of classic Disney storytelling is nowhere to be found, replaced with a soulless attempt at reinvention that no one asked for. Instead of breathing new life into a beloved fairy tale, this version strips away everything that made Snow White special in the first place.",1/10
"I watched Snow White hoping for a fun, magical experience, but was severely disappointed. The plot was overly simplistic and predictable, leaving no room for surprises. The acting felt forced, especially Snow White herself, who lacked depth and emotion. The CGI was tacky, distracting from the otherwise enchanting world they were trying to create. The pacing was slow, and at times, the scenes dragged on unnecessarily. The film failed to capture the charm of the original fairy tale and felt like a soulless cash grab. Overall, it was a forgettable experience that left me frustrated. Would not recommend.",1/10

What were some things to comment that were missing? The passion and enthusiasm inspired by the women that made strong connections before us. Rebelling against that nature is equivalent to taking a nap in a self driving car on a highspeed highway. The end result would make insurance companies pat theirselves on the back.

The use of character creation was like getting cat fished. There was no accurate detail on what the dwarves mannerism and appearance should actually be. There comes a time and place for a diverse setting but that also means naming the movie with a different title.",1/10

"This could have been one of the best movies from Disney for this year but it was ruined by horrible CGI and Gal Gadots astronomically horrible acting skills and ""singing voice"". Only the scenes with Rachel were actually good. Wish I could rate this at 0. Instead of making rush works like this maybe Disney needs to focus on selecting better actors and investing in films. I felt like I was watching Cats again. How can someone be so void of emotion (Gal Gadot). I wish I could write Disney for a refund. The Directors should never touch camera. Let's not ruin another classic with horrible acting and temu CGI.",1/10
"That's by the far the worst remake movie ever.

They made it something other than the original story and the cast is completely off. I would never recommend anyone to see it. A total waste of money and time. They should have stuck with the original story and had a cast that look like the original cartoon. They also shouldn't have made the dworfs CGI because there are so many actors that could have made that significantly better. And to top it off they casted the worst fakest actress gal gadot which can't even deliver one line properly without acting like she is faking it. Conclusion you are better off without it.",1/10
"It was a terrible movie. I strongly advise against taking your kids to see it, as it would be a complete waste of time. The plot was poorly executed, the acting was subpar, and the overall experience was frustrating. By the time the credits rolled, I regretted ever watching it. If I could give it a 0/10, I would. Save your time and money - there are far better movies out there that deserve your attention. Trust me, this one is not worth it. The special effects were unconvincing, the dialogue felt forced, and the pacing dragged endlessly. It lacked any emotional depth or engaging moments. Even the soundtrack failed to add any excitement.",1/10
"I genuinely struggled to immerse myself in the film. It was difficult to separate Rachel, the actress, from the character of Snow White. Every scene felt like I was just watching Rachel in a low-budget costume rather than the beloved fairy tale heroine. There was no trace of the original magic that made Snow White so iconic. The charm, whimsy, and enchantment that should have been there simply weren't. Instead, the entire portrayal felt forced, lacking the authenticity and wonder that define a timeless classic. It never truly captured the essence of the story, leaving it feeling hollow and forgettable.",1/10

"I don't even know where to begin with Snow White. This film is a mess from start to finish. The plot? Completely unrealistic - a girl lives with seven random dudes in the woods and everyone's cool with it? Please. The acting is wooden, the pacing is painfully slow, and the characters have the depth of a puddle after a light drizzle.

The Evil Queen is more annoying than scary, and Snow White herself is so naive it's frustrating. Who takes food from a clearly suspicious old woman in the middle of nowhere? She basically asked to be poisoned.

The dwarfs - meant to be charming - come off as bizarre caricatures with names that sound like rejected usernames. The songs are catchy, sure, but that only makes them more irritating when you can't get them out of your head for days. The animation (if it's the classic version) looks like it was drawn by someone who got bored halfway through.

By the end, I was rooting for the apple.

1/10 - would not recommend unless you're studying how not to make a movie.",1/10
"I have to say, the new Snow White left me feeling pretty underwhelmed. Despite its stunning visuals, the film just couldn't recapture the magic of the original story. The plot felt muddled and rushed, as if it were trying too hard to be modern and cool without giving enough room for the characters to truly come alive. Even the iconic characters seemed to lose some of their charm, turning into one-dimensional figures that didn't resonate emotionally. It felt like a missed opportunity-more of a flashy rehash than a fresh take on a timeless classic. Ultimately, while the film dazzles on the surface, it fails to deliver the heart and soul that made the original Snow White so beloved.",1/10
"If you're thinking ""I'm sure everyone is just being silly it can't be that bad"". Think again. It's worse. The fact people watched this and said it was fine for release is criminal. Poor acting, poor CGI, poor changes to the original and the most woeful release tour and marketing in history cements this as rightfully the worst ever movie to be released. Do yourselves a favour don't even consider it. The theatres are empty for a reason it is HOT GARBAGE. If people aren't fired because of this atrocity then something dodgy is happening. I don't even want a refund. This movie has showed me I've been too critical of others.",1/10

"Gal Gadot's performance is an unmitigated disaster, turning a beloved fairy tale character into a wooden and utterly charmless figure. Every line she delivers is so stilted and awkward, it's as if she's reading from a teleprompter for the first time. Her attempt at conveying emotion is so forced, viewers might find more depth in a cardboard cutout. This performance not only strips all the enchantment and vitality from Snow White, but it's a painful reminder that star power alone can't inject life into a fundamentally flawed script. It's a catastrophic miscasting that will likely go down as one of the most tone-deaf interpretations of a classic character in cinema history.",1/10
"Disney made much better movies about 15-10 years ago. Then the quality has started to lower year by year. Wondering can it be any lower but apparently it can. Acting was horrible only Gal Gadot really tried to save the movie but even she can't carry the whole cast.

The CGI was akward on everything. It is really really hard to think anything positive to say about the movie. I quess there was couple of songs that were not per say good but tolerable...

If you really are intriqued about the movie i would rather wait it to hit the streaming services. It really isn't worth the ticket to the movies.",1/10
"The CGI was absolutely atrocious-sloppy, unfinished, and downright embarrassing for a movie with this kind of budget. The acting was painfully mediocre, with performances so flat and uninspired that it felt like no one wanted to be there. Most of the actors didn't fit their characters at all, making it impossible to get immersed in the story. Speaking of the story, the only thing they had going for them was the original tale, and yet they still managed to completely butcher it with terrible writing, unnecessary changes, and a total lack of charm. It's as if the filmmakers had no idea what made the original so beloved. The pacing dragged, the dialogue was awkward, and the entire film lacked heart. This was two hours of my life I will never get back-time I could have spent doing literally anything else, and it would have been more fulfilling.

"I watched the Snow White movie, and to be honest, it just didn't work for me. While the visuals were stunning and clearly a highlight, the rest of the film fell short. The characters didn't feel fully developed, and their interactions lacked a natural flow, which made it hard to connect with them. On top of that, the pacing felt off-some scenes felt rushed, which took away from the emotional weight of the story.

The film tried to give a modern twist to the classic tale, but in doing so, it seemed to lose the heart and charm that made the original so special. Even the dialogue and humor felt a bit out of place at times, making the story feel disconnected. Overall, while it looked great, it felt like the focus on visuals came at the expense of a meaningful and engaging story.",1/10
"Disney's latest cash grab proves that even $250 million can't polish a turd of a script into a diamond. Rachel Zegler sings her heart out, but it's like putting lipstick on a CGI dwarf-pointless and creepy. Gal Gadot hams it up as the Evil Queen so hard you'd think she's auditioning for a community theatre panto, while the new songs are so forgettable they'd lose a duel with elevator muzak. The dwarfs look like they stumbled out of a 2005 video game cutscene, and the plot's so choppy it feels like it was edited with a magic mirror set to 'random.' This remake's a poisoned apple-skip it and save your happily ever after for something less coma-inducing.",1/10
"A film so lacking in direction even Gadot's performance was poor .

For once watching a Disney film the audience were left supporting a villain, as the only way to save this film would have been for the royal huntsman to follow though with the queens request.

If they wanted to change the story , that's the change that could have saved this film .

As it was it's clunky graphics with some shocking performance leaving you feeling that Disney was so focused on changes they totally forgot the story line .

When Margot was asked to play Barbie, she had one request , it must contain Barbies dream house , and the rest is history.

"I came into the movie with low expectations, but the move was actually not bad. Had a few laughs and good songs. Give it a try, it's not bad. The dwarves got some taking used to but their song and their humor was pretty entertaining. The love interest was different but the musical number with him was pretty good as well. Had a couple songs stuck in my head after watching. Gal Gadot was probably something i'd switch but it's somewhat alright as it's somewhat forgettable. Many fans say they prefer the original.

"Disney's 2025 remake of Snow White arrives with much anticipation but ultimately falls flat, primarily due to a lacklustre performance by its lead. Despite impressive visual effects and elegant production design, the film struggles to engage viewers, overshadowed by its underwhelming portrayal of the iconic princess.

At the heart of the film's failures is the casting and execution of Snow White herself, whose depiction lacks both charisma and warmth. A character renowned for her charm and enchantment, Snow White here becomes a strangely energy-draining presence. Far from captivating, her presence feels awkward and forced, undermining the entire film's tone. Rather than being swept away in a magical retelling, audiences may find themselves struggling to remain seated, experiencing discomfort instead of delight.

In stark contrast, Gal Gadot delivers an outstanding performance as the villain, breathing fresh energy and charm into every scene she commands. Gadot's vibrant portrayal of malevolent charisma creates a stark disparity, highlighting even more clearly the deficiencies in the film's lead performance. Her dynamic screen presence serves as a constant reminder of what the film might have been, had the central casting been more thoughtfully considered.

Unfortunately, Gadot alone cannot salvage the overall experience. As Snow White falters, so too does the audience's patience, culminating in a sense of regret rather than wonder. For those hoping for Disney's magic at its best, Snow White disappoints profoundly, leaving viewers questioning the value of their theater ticket.

In conclusion, Disney's latest remake proves to be a missed opportunity. While Gadot's villain injects vitality, the film is ultimately burdened by its bland, uninspired protagonist. For many viewers, sitting through this adaptation may feel more like an endurance test than entertainment, making Snow White (2025) difficult to recommend.",1/10
I went go my ticket and I was going to give it a try once me and my boyfriend started seeing it nothing to do with snow white I get it's not old times but still I grow up seeing princess movie and to this one got me disappointed. The evil queen did a good job on staying on role but snow white didn't give what I was expecting as a princess. I don't recommend seeing it. If you do try to get those tickets for free cause for what I paid for not worth. Me and my boyfriend fell sleep. Just wait until disney + bring it out. Honestly I wouldn't see it again. It was not worth it. Like the main artist say I saw it but I would not pick it up again.,1/10
I can't see any good in this movie even CG of the seven Dwarf look like a video game CG more than a real life. Snow White in the movie must be white in the original and she should has more gentle than this like the original and for Gal Gadot in the movie she doesn't have any power when she sing the song it don't have any impact or something else but I have to say that Dwarfs song is better than the original for the 8 gang that they do for the king or something I can't remember the name why you added them most of them are useless even the leader except king of crossbow he's more useful than the leader.,1/10
"This is the garbage the name of movie that does CGI quality of this movie is very very Very bad in the characters look glitchy in this is all the test of the movies of waste of time . And the actress are all acting are very A lifeless, soulless remake that strips away everything magical about the original Snow White. The lead performance is dull, lacking any charm or warmth, while the rewritten story removes key elements that made the classic so beloved. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is forgettable, failing to bring any real menace to the role. The CGI-heavy visuals feel artificial, and the new songs are utterly unmemorable. Instead of honoring the original, this film tries too hard to modernize the story, resulting in a bland, joyless experience. Another unnecessary Disney remake that fails on every level.",1/10
"Where do I even begin? This movie is an insult to the original tale, the fans, and frankly, to filmmaking in general. If Disney wanted to completely strip Snow White of its charm, heart, and soul, then congratulations - mission accomplished.

First of all, the script feels like it was written by a committee of people who have never seen a fairy tale, much less understood one. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, the pacing drags endlessly, and the ""modern updates"" feel more like awkward virtue signaling than actual storytelling.

Snow White herself is barely recognizable - not just in appearance, but in character. She's cold, preachy, and somehow manages to have zero chemistry with anyone else on screen. I wasn't rooting for her. I was begging for the end credits. And don't even get me started on the dwarfs... or rather, the random collection of ""diverse companions"" who seem thrown together at the last minute with no clear purpose other than to check boxes.

Visually? Flat. Dull. Lifeless. For a film that's supposed to be a fantasy, there's absolutely no magic. The CGI looks like it was done on a budget of $15 and a YouTube tutorial.

Disney has taken a beloved story and twisted it into something unrecognizable, joyless, and completely out of touch. If this is the future of reimaginings, count me out.

Avoid at all costs.",1/10
"The new Snow White movie is a complete disappointment. It strays far from the beloved original, stripping away the charm, heart, and magic that made the classic so special. The storytelling feels forced, the characters lack depth, and the changes to the core themes seem unnecessary and uninspired. The visuals, while polished, fail to capture the whimsy and wonder of the original fairy tale. Worse still, the performances are flat, making it hard to connect with the protagonist or care about her journey. This remake feels like a hollow cash grab rather than a respectful reimagining, and fans of the original will likely walk away frustrated.",1/10
"Disney's new ""Snow White"" is a lackluster remake that saps the vibrancy from the beloved classic. Rachel Zegler's Snow White feels one-dimensional, her powerful voice squandered on forgettable tunes like ""Waiting on a Wish,"" which lack the heart of the original soundtrack. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is oddly subdued, delivering a stiff performance that fails to capture the character's iconic menace. The CGI dwarfs are a jarring misstep-creepy rather than charming-while the plot staggers under clunky, modern revisions that clash with the fairy-tale essence. With a bloated $270 million budget, the visuals are surprisingly drab, and the emotional core is absent. This live-action slog proves Disney's remake machine has run out of steam. One star for trying, but it's a chore to watch.",1/10
"Kids love it! Well it's a kids story anyway and kids don't see color, nor give a damn about the so called wokeness.

It's high time our world appreciates talent and creativity without judging who's playing a role.

This movie is a masterpiece with great music and great visuals. Not the first movie to have certain characters played by CGI, nor will it be the last.

It's note a woke movie, it's just a movie adapted for this generation.

They're turning all kids stories into horror these days and we're loving them. Maybe that's what Disney should do next time, turn an adorable magical story into a slasher, gory flick.

Impressive movie.",10/10
"This is incredibly bad and should be a case for giving zero stars. It's a rotten poison apple, almost like someone is purposely trying to sink Disney forever. They have to feel the financial pain of stupid decisions like this, and it seems like stockholders should be around to a class action lawsuit by now based on their poor choices. This has to be a plan for Disney to fail. Check the writers for shorting Disney stock.

This retelling is hugely lacking in almost every way. Gal Gadot is WAY prettier than ""Snow White."" Where are the prince/princess notes of the original? The CGI of the animals looks very dull, and the songs omitted key ones from the original. Don't even get me started on the sinister CGI Dwarves (that look like they are made for a horror film about killer Dwarves or Leprechauns). This is a bad movie even if you ignore the socialist undertones crossed with ""me a powerful woe-man"" that doesnt need a prince cliches. This is a steaming pile of ""don't waste your time"" with the added risk of giving younger children nightmares.",1/10
"SuckSnow White is one of the most overrated Disney movies ever made. The plot is painfully predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the pacing is sluggish. Snow White herself is frustratingly naive, spending most of the film either singing to animals or waiting for a prince to save her. The Evil Queen, while visually striking, has a weak motivation-why does she even need a magic mirror to tell her she's not the fairest? Get a grip!

The dwarfs, while mildly entertaining, rely on shallow personality traits rather than real character development. The prince? He barely exists in the story but somehow gets to ""save the day"" with a creepy unsolicited kiss.",1/10
"As a child, Snow White was my go-to Disney movie, but now at 23, I wish I never saw it. The 2025 remake is an abomination, draining the magic out of it. The CGI dwarves are stiff, the story a muddled mess, and Snow White herself is not endearing. The awkward ""modern"" twists to the classic story ruin the original and render it dull and unidentifiable. Even the songs are forgettable. It was almost a betrayal to my childhood seeing this lifeless remake. Instead of nostalgia, I was left disappointed, and it just goes to show not every classic movie needs to be remade.overall I wish Disney make up for that.",1/10
"This live-action adaptation of Snow White is an unfortunate reminder that some stories are better left in their original form. The film attempts to imbue the classic tale with a sense of grandeur and depth, but in doing so, it strips away the charm and lightheartedness that made the story so enduring. The performances, while earnest, fall flat-none of the characters feel as vivid or compelling as they should, and the dialogue often feels forced. Worst of all, the over-reliance on CGI and spectacle undermines the simple, timeless magic of the original, leaving the film a hollow and tedious experience. Rachel Sieger.",1/10
"Bad animation!!! The ruined the original story. Their is no hart in the movie. The evil Queen is campy, and prettier then Snow White. The Seven Dwarfs animation looks cheap, and you can tell, it was added as an after thought. Why is Disney ruining classic movies? The stores are great, and they chage the story, to try to be contemporary, and it never works. Instead, it upsets the audiences. When you start with a beloved story, that is a classic, why fix something that is not broke. When will Disney learn to stop changing the original storylines, and changing the characters with actors that do not look like the original characters!",1/10
"Either Disney or the main character have no sense of what the actual plot and story of Snow White is or they do not care, the actress that play the main character of Snow White also seems to be out of touch with the character very poorly written and acting. They should have used actual people to play the dwarves for these roles, Gal gadot played her role pretty well, but the same can't be said the actress who played Snow White unfortunately, Disney should have recasted the main role of Snow White, this epic failure will be remembered for a while, hopefully this will make Disney re-evaluate their views, Racheal Zegler should consider another career option, acting or singing unfortunately will not be the best option for her.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is nothing short of a catastrophe. From the moment the first trailer dropped, it was clear that this remake was going to be controversial, but no one could have predicted just how badly it would turn out.

First, let's talk about the writing-or rather, the lack of it. The story abandons the charm and simplicity of the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and replaces it with a bland, uninspired plot that feels more like a generic fantasy movie than a beloved fairy tale. The dialogue is painfully forced, with characters delivering lines that sound more like modern social commentary than timeless storytelling.

Then, there's the casting. While diverse representation is always welcome when done well, here it feels completely out of place and forced. Rachel Zegler, despite being a talented actress, delivers a lifeless performance as Snow White, lacking the warmth, innocence, and wonder that made the original character so beloved. Meanwhile, the replacement of the dwarfs with generic ""magical creatures"" is another baffling decision that strips the film of its personality.

The visuals are another disappointment. Unlike Cinderella (2015) or Beauty and the Beast (2017), which at least had stunning production design, Snow White (2025) looks surprisingly cheap for a Disney blockbuster. The CGI is inconsistent, the costumes lack the elegance of the original designs, and the overall cinematography feels dull and uninspired.

And then there's the music-or the lack of it. The removal of classic songs like Heigh-Ho and Someday My Prince Will Come is a huge mistake. Instead of giving us memorable melodies, the film settles for forgettable, generic background scores that leave no lasting impression.

Overall, Snow White (2025) is a lifeless, unnecessary remake that no one asked for and even fewer will enjoy. Disney seems more interested in rewriting its own history than respecting the magic that made its classics timeless. If you love the original Snow White, do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1/10
"Very bad. The worst movie I've seen in 5 years. Bad acting, unnatural dialogue, tragic special effects. Disney has not only hit rock bottom, but has gone even deeper.

Let me just start by saying this: Snow White is not just a bad movie. It is a cinematic disaster, a monumental failure, and a complete waste of time, money, and brain cells. I honestly believe that watching this film made me a dumber person. It's almost impressive how a movie can get everything so incredibly wrong. I would rather watch paint dry, or stare at a wall for two hours, than ever sit through this horror again.

Let's talk about the visuals. You'd think in this day and age we'd at least get some decent effects or imaginative scenery. Nope. What we get instead looks like someone filmed it using a 2004 flip phone and edited it using Windows Movie Maker. The forest scenes look like someone's backyard, and the dwarfs? Don't even get me started on the dwarfs. They're not charming. They're not funny. They're annoying. Like, painfully annoying. Every second they're on screen made me want to scream into a pillow.",1/10

"I'm genuinely not tired of like action remakes. What I am tired of, is Disney taking a loved story and changing every aspect of it. I would pay good money to go to the theaters and watch a frame by frame live action remake of the original movie. NO CHANGES NEEDED TO BE MADE. The casting was awful. Acting was awful. Even the songs were horrible. No part of this move was worth watching. Live actions hold so much potential! Disney needs to do it right or go broke and let someone else have a shot. This movie should be buried and a new movie made to take its place. What a shame how this movie turned out.",1/10
"A Disastrous Display of Acting:

It's not often that a film completely falls apart due to the sheer incompetence of its cast, but snow white achieves this unfortunate feat with stunning effectiveness. From the very first scene, it becomes painfully clear that the actors are either woefully miscast, entirely uninterested, or simply incapable of delivering convincing performances. This movie serves as a masterclass in how poor acting can single-handedly ruin an otherwise promising premise.

Wooden Performances and Zero Chemistry

One of the most glaring issues with this film is the complete lack of chemistry between the actors. Whether it's supposed to be a heartfelt romance, an intense rivalry, or a deep friendship, every relationship in this movie feels forced and unnatural. The lead actors, in particular, seem completely disconnected from their characters and each other. Scenes that should have been filled with passion or tension instead feel lifeless, as if the performers are merely reciting their lines without any understanding of their meaning.

It doesn't help that the dialogue is already weak, but even the best script in the world would struggle to shine with such uninspired delivery. Emotional scenes feel robotic, with actors delivering their lines as if they're reading from a teleprompter for the first time. Even when a character is supposed to be devastated, angry, or overwhelmed with joy, the actors fail to convey any genuine feeling. The result is a series of moments that should be powerful but instead induce unintentional laughter or, worse, boredom.

Overacting and Unnatural Expressions

While some members of the cast seem completely detached, others take the opposite approach-overacting to a ridiculous degree. Instead of expressing emotions naturally, these actors resort to exaggerated facial expressions, unnatural pauses, and theatrical gestures that feel more suited to a low-budget soap opera than a feature film. This excessive dramatization completely takes the audience out of the experience, making it impossible to take any scene seriously.

One particularly awful performance comes from main caracter, whose attempts at intensity result in a series of bizarre grimaces and over-the-top line deliveries. Every word feels forced, every gesture unnatural. It's as if they're trying to compensate for their lack of true emotion by pushing everything to an absurd level. Instead of drawing the viewer into the story, their presence makes every scene feel like an awkward high school play.

Supporting Cast: Just as Bad, If Not Worse

If the leads are bad, the supporting cast is even worse. Many side characters serve as nothing more than walking clichés, with actors delivering their lines in the most uninspired and unconvincing ways imaginable. Whether it's a villain who sounds like they're imitating a cartoon bad guy or a best friend character who has zero personality, every performance feels like a failed audition.

There are moments where it seems like some of the actors are aware of how bad the movie is and have simply given up. Instead of trying to bring life to their roles, they lazily go through the motions, making it clear that they're just there for the paycheck. In a movie that desperately needs at least one compelling performance, this level of indifference makes the experience all the more unbearable.

Final Verdict: A Complete Disaster

Even with a weak script and bad direction, a movie can sometimes be saved by strong performances. Unfortunately, snow white has nothing of the sort. The acting is, without a doubt, its biggest downfall, making it impossible to invest in the story or care about any of the characters. With wooden delivery, exaggerated overacting, and zero chemistry, this film stands as a testament to how crucial a talented cast is to a movie's success.

If you're looking for an example of how bad acting can completely destroy a film, look no further. This is a performance disaster from start to finish, and no amount of good cinematography or decent action sequences can make up for it. Save your time and skip this mess-you won't regret it.",1/10
HORRIBLE MOVIE! Gal Gadot can't act her way out of paper bag! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! This film is not worth a second of your life! Talk I cant believe they hired Gal Gadot for this role. Very poor acting skills and very unimpressive as the evil Queen. I mean there are SO MANY much Better actrices ! What was Disney thinking? What am insult to the wonderful story of Snow White - a true classic! This film is an abomination! Again please don't waste your money and spend it on something worthwhile. For the story of Snow White please have your family watch one of the wonderful classic versions! They are SO MUCH BETTER!,1/10
"I went into the new Snow White movie hoping for a fresh take on the classic story, but instead, I got a masterclass in wooden acting courtesy of Gal Gadot. As the evil queen, she delivers her lines with all the menace of a mildly annoyed tik toker. Every scene she's in feels like a forced, over-rehearsed monologue rather than a genuine performance. Her facial expressions barely change, her delivery is flat, and her attempts at being intimidating are laughable.

The Evil Queen should be a figure of terrifying elegance, someone who commands the screen with every glance. Instead, Gadot just... stands there, posing like she's still in a perfume commercial. Even when she tries to be cruel or sinister, it comes across as awkward, like she's just reciting lines she doesn't quite understand. At no point did she feel like a genuine threat to Snow White, it was hard to believe anyone would be scared of her.",1/10
"The movie was nonsense. The main thing is that it should never have been done. The joy and the allure of animation is that you can do things that are larger and more exaggerated than life itself. In a word, it's funnier. That's what makes it so entertaining. The story of Snow White itself is a classic, of course. But what made the story even more popular was that the visual format of its presentation was captivating and wonderous. Well, the answer is that, that is not what they were trying to do. They weren't trying to recapture the magic of the original. They weren't trying to find a new audience or provide the world with wonderful new entertainment. They were ""going back to the well"", as I like to call it. That is to say, they had no new ideas, so they decided to take an old idea, and simply capitalize on that existing fandom.",1/10
"I was very excited for this movie because I have loved all of the other live action princess remakes. Unfortunately, it didn't impress. I think Rachel is a wonderful singer and did a great job with the musical aspect, but some parts of her acting make it awkward to watch. I think the dwarfs being CGI looked weird and it would've been better to just use actual little people or just shorter individuals. The evil queen was terrible. I liked Gal in Wonder Woman, but she was terrible in this movie. Her acting was awful and her singing was not enjoyable. I just wanted to laugh while watching her singing scenes. I don't love how they changed the storyline of her looking for a prince. I am all about women being able to take care of themselves, but you should've just made a different story then.",3/10
"First of let's talk about snow white, the actress didn't master the role, you should have brought another one.

Second, the evil queen, or gal Gadot, omg, everyone hates her role-plays In every movie.

And come on Disney, you're ruining the stories that we watched and read in our childhood, I think you should rewatch your movie again and you may know, why everyone hates that movie.

And lastly, you should read the original stories of your next topics, and please please just choose appropriate actors and actresses for your next movie, we don't have to teach you something you can do well and that's it.",1/10
"From my 7 years old niece who just watch it yesterday: "" it's bad, like it's nothing like i imagine. It doesn't have that fairytale feeling"" I see someone said that "" this is a kid movie, we shouldn't imposed our standards bla bla bla"" but even their customer persona don't like it then how can we said that this is a good movie.

We expect a fantasy, a fairy tale film that can actually consider one. Maybe you have forgotten but fairytale is not about skin colors, race, gender,... It's about feelings, magic, wonderful stuff, colorful world,... and it's even more important when it come to a children movie. If you think that this is a good fairytale story then i'm sorry for your childhood, it must be miserable.",1/10
"I'll keep it short and sweet... go see the movie for yourself. In MY opinion... it was GREAT!! Visually stunning, stayed pretty true to the original story (a few modifications), and LOVE the diversity (thank you Disney)!! Go see it on the big screen; loved the dwarfs (especially Dopey). Just go to the movie theater and have a good time.

Again, in MY opinion- I think it's still a luxury to see movies on the big screen. I don't go often, and to finally have the opportunity to see a Disney movie as an adult on the big screen still gets me excited, like a kid!! And to see families to take their children and little girls dressed in their Snow White princess costumes never gets old! Just keep an open mind, have fun and remember.... It's entertainment!! (With a positive message). Thank you for reading!",10/10
"Well, I tried to ignore all of the negativity around the Movie, but....no smoke without fire...it certainly does seem like 2 films have been scrambled together by a huge team with differing ideas on the tone of the final production. Sets and characters don't gel together, Snow White comes across as very unlikable....though after rewatching some of the Press clips about the film, it doesn't seem like much acting was required to achieve that.

Even my young kids weren't impressed, seems to miss the mark on many levels...

It is a tedious summary of everything wrong with modern cinema. I am sure it will be used as a textbook example of what not to do.",1/10
"Disney's live-action Snow White is honestly such a letdown. It feels like they took everything magical about the original and swapped it out for boring CGI and a story that tries way too hard to be modern. The cast is great on paper, but even Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot couldn't save it from feeling flat and lifeless. In fact, Rachel's performance somehow managed to drag the whole thing down even further - she just doesn't capture the charm or likability the character deserves.

The CGI dwarfs are just weird, and the new songs? Totally forgettable. The whole thing feels like they were trying to check off a list instead of making something fun or heartfelt. If you love the original, this one will probably just leave you disappointed and wishing they had left it alone.",1/10
"I watched the 2025 Snow White remake, and honestly, it was disappointing. The story felt overly changed, losing the charm of the original. While Rachel Zegler gave a decent performance as Snow White, Gal Gadot's Evil Queen lacked depth and didn't leave much of an impression. The CGI used for the dwarfs was unappealing and looked out of place, which took away from the visual experience. On top of that, Rachel Zegler herself brought a lot of unnecessary controversy to the movie with her comments in the media, which didn't sit well with fans. The whole film felt more like a forced attempt at modernization rather than a heartfelt retelling of a classic. It's a shame because it had the potential to be so much more.",1/10
"Absolutely awful. Worst movie I've ever seen. Whatever magic the original had has been completely butchered in this soulless, preachy mess. Snow White isn't charming or inspiring-just insufferable. The story's been gutted, the characters are unrecognisable, and the whole thing feels like a bad school play with a Hollywood budget. The visuals were dull, the pacing dragged, and somehow they made a fairy tale feel like a corporate HR training video.

Snow White herself has no warmth, no joy, and delivers every line like she's reading a motivational poster. There's no heart, no adventure, and not a single moment that made me feel anything except second-hand embarrassment. Even the dwarfs-if you can call them that-felt like awkward stand-ins from a completely different movie.

I didn't expect a masterpiece, but I also didn't expect to leave the cinema feeling like I'd need counselling. This wasn't just bad. It was offensive to anyone who grew up loving the original. Avoid at all costs. Disney owes us an apology-and possibly compensation for emotional damage.",1/10

"Disney's latest live-action debacle, Snow White (2025), is a cinematic catastrophe that manages to tarnish a timeless classic with an unholy blend of soulless revisionism and visual repugnance. Rachel Zegler, despite her vocal talents, is utterly miscast as a Snow White devoid of charm or depth, sleepwalking through a narrative so aimlessly butchered it feels like a parody of itself. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is a wooden, over-theatrical disaster, delivering lines with all the menace of a department store mannequin, while the CGI dwarfs-grotesque, uncanny abominations-look like they stumbled out of a rejected video game cutscene. The film's bloated $270 million budget somehow translates into cheap, plasticky sets and costumes that scream ""supermarket Halloween clearance,"" leaving you wondering where the money went-certainly not into creativity or coherence.

This Snow White doesn't just stumble-it belly-flops into a pit of exhaustingly awful decisions, stripping away every ounce of magic from the 1937 original. The screenplay, a muddled mess of half-baked political posturing and lifeless dialogue, replaces romance and wonder with a preachy, self-congratulatory slog that alienates fans and newcomers alike. New songs from Pasek and Paul are forgettable at best, cringe-inducing at worst, while the pacing drags like a funeral march through a forest of gnarled, grasping clichés. It's a film so listless and devoid of heart that it feels like Disney actively despises its own legacy, serving up a steaming pile of corporate cynicism that dares you to stay awake through its joyless runtime. Mirror, mirror on the wall, this is the most abysmal remake of them all.",1/10
"Do yourself a favor and just watch the original. Sadly, wasn't a good movie. I wish I didn't watch it. This remake was not good at all. It's sad because Snow White was one of my favorite movies as a child and I was so excited to see the new one. It was so amazing to see all the other movie remakes; Cinderella, Mulan, Lady and the tramp. The list goes on. Sad that Snow White sucked. I really wish I didn't watch it. Was a waste of my money and time. I wish I walked out and got my money back for the movie but I wanted to give it a try. Maybe they will remake it again? Haha that would be so cool and keep it like the original.",1/10
"Just saw the movie and I have to say this has to be one of the worst written movie of the decade. If the beauty is inner beauty then in whole kingdom no one has inner beauty other than evil queen until snow white came? What a joke... And the Evil Queen (Gal Godot) is jealous of Snow White (Racheal)? No words to describe this horrible piece. The story traditionally hinges on the Queen's vanity and jealousy of Snow White's outer and inner beauty-her kindness and purity-which the Magic Mirror deems ""fairest of all."" In this adaptation, the Queen's envy still fuels her evil actions, though the film reportedly shifts some focus to Snow White's leadership and agency.",1/10

"One of the worst stories ever told, lacking any depth or originality. The performances are careless and uninspired, making it difficult to connect with the characters. The script is poorly woven, filled with inconsistencies and weak dialogue that fail to engage the audience. The excessive use of CGI feels overwhelming and detracts from any potential immersion. The soundtrack is utterly generic, offering nothing distinctive or memorable. There is not a single redeeming element in this film that stands out in a positive way. If this is considered one of the year's major releases, one can only hope that the future of cinema is not as bleak as this production suggests.",1/10
"Disney's 2015 remake of Cinderella is truly magical. I have watched it at least once a year or maybe more since it came out. It's a masterful piece of storytelling, acting and cinematography that stirs your emotions and makes you feel something real. The whole movie you're rooting for Cinderella to overcome her oppression and live happily ever after. They remained true to the original story that people have loved for generations. To me it is a work of art.

10 years on, Disney has failed to mirror the same success with their remake of Snow White and I will not be watching this once a year moving forward, most likely I'll never watch it again. I found it difficult to like any of the characters. For me it was neither magical nor enchanting and has not captured my heart.

Thankfully I still have Cinderella to fall back on.",1/10
"This movie is a masterclass in how to ruin a beloved fairytale. Rachel Zegler's performance is less 'fairest of them all' and more 'most painfully uninterested.' She spends the whole film looking like she'd rather be anywhere else, delivering lines with the enthusiasm of someone reading the terms and conditions of a phone contract.

The iconic story is twisted into something unrecognizable, with none of the heart, wonder, or magic that made the original a classic. The writing is hollow, the characters are flat, and the overall tone feels like a parody of itself.

If Disney's goal was to alienate fans, confuse kids, and destroy nostalgia in under two hours, then congratulations - mission accomplished.",1/10
"But I guess I'm here aren't I?

I won't go into details on the bad CGI, the terrible green screening, the stage-like feel of the productions. Others have and you can see those if you want.

What I'm here to talk about is.

Vibrato Instability.

I listened to Ms Zegler and Mrs Gadot singing and in both I had moments that you shouldn't have in a Disney film.

I flinched at the singing where in certain points, the actresses voices went off-key or warbled enough that it was distinctly noticeable.

And while I think that an actress who does present themselves as a singer is someone I can forgive for warbly singing or clunky attempts at pitch. When you're one who styles herself as being able to sing, making your - admittedly very small - audience flinch at those flat notes, off-keys and screeching vocals is not something you want to do.

I understand that hitting the high note is something any singer would want to do, and that nominally it's something that a good singer can do, but really Disney... was it that hard to get multiple takes of this song to mix them together so that you don't end up making your audience think it's a Jump Scare Sting?",1/10

"Disney's Snow White (2025) is yet another misguided attempt to modernize a classic, but instead of breathing new life into the beloved fairy tale, it strips away everything that made the original special. With uninspired performances, weak visuals, and forgettable music, this film serves as a prime example of why not every animated masterpiece needs a live-action remake.

Rachel Zegler: A Snow White Lacking Charm Casting Rachel Zegler as Snow White seemed like an interesting choice, but unfortunately, her performance falls flat. While her singing ability is undeniable, her acting lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the character. Instead of a sweet and kindhearted princess, this Snow White comes across as distant, and at times, even uninterested in the story unfolding around her.

"This movie was an absolute disaster-extremely boring from start to finish. The acting, especially from Gal Gadot, was lifeless and flat. I honestly can't understand why she was cast in this role; her performance completely dragged the film down and ruined it for me. I couldn't get invested in any part of the movie, and every time Gal Gadot appeared on screen, it just made things worse and really made me sick in the stomach. It felt like the longest, most painful experience ever that I don't wish upon an enemy. This movie has to go down as one of the worst I've ever watched-unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.",1/10
"It's not good at all.

I mean I appreciate the actors haven't done themselves any favours and their acting is nothing to remember them by in any sense of the meaning, but seriously the writers and people in charge of this whole production should be ashamed of themselves... for churning out this rehashed unwanted and infuriating remake of a much loved classic.

What a way to just completely cheapen everything to do with Snow White in general.

The figures and financials tell you all you need to know... people want to watch good movies, not ones that will leave a bad taste in their mouth and that has nothing to do with the plot, acting, actors, expense, subject matter

A BIG thumbs down and grandad-face at Snow White! Flop floppity flopflop.",1/10
"The new live-action Snow White is a spectacular failure, offering nothing but disappointment for fans of the beloved classic. What should have been a nostalgic yet fresh retelling of the iconic fairy tale turns into a convoluted, tone-deaf mess that fails to capture the magic of the original.

First, the casting feels out of place. Rachel Zegler's Snow White seems miscast, offering little charm or depth to the character. Her portrayal lacks the innocence and warmth that made Snow White so beloved in the animated classic. Meanwhile, the decision to make Snow White an activist figure-an odd update in a story where the original focus was on innocence and purity-feels forced and disconnected from the source material.

The script is riddled with cringe-worthy dialogue, stripping away any sense of wonder in favor of unnecessary modern political commentary. The dwarfs, too, are given an awkwardly reworked treatment. The attempt to diversify their portrayal does not feel genuine but instead seems like a box-checking exercise. The result is a group of characters who neither add to the story nor bring the fun and charm they were meant to.

The visual effects, which should have been a saving grace, fall flat. While there are some striking landscapes, much of the film is bogged down by overreliance on CGI that looks cheap and artificial. This cheapens the experience and fails to create the sense of enchantment that Disney's live-action films often evoke. The dark, drab color palette further adds to the lackluster atmosphere.

The biggest disappointment, however, is the overall tone of the film. The once-whimsical world of Snow White is now an unrecognizable, gloomy place. The whimsical magic of the forest, the joy of Snow White's connection with nature, and the warm charm of the original film are replaced by a hollow, soulless world that doesn't inspire the same emotional connection. The pacing is sluggish, with moments of humor and heart nowhere to be found.

In conclusion, Snow White (2025) is a complete misfire. It fails to capture the heart of the original while trying-unsuccessfully-to update the story for a modern audience. It's a movie that misses the mark on every level, from casting to script, direction, and visual execution. Disney's attempt at reimagining a classic turns into a dull and frustrating experience, leaving fans of the original film wishing they'd left well enough alone.",1/10
"This movie is a masterclass in missing the mark so badly it's almost performance art. Picture this: Snow White, now a bossy motivational speaker with the charm of a soggy napkin, stomping around in a dress so garishly bright it could wake up a coma patient. Forget the sweet, creature-loving gal from the original, she's been replaced by a heroine whose ""dreams"" are shouted at you every five minutes like a malfunctioning self-help audiobook. I half-expected her to sell me a timeshare by the end.

Then there's Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, who's less ""terrifying villain"" and more ""Instagram influencer having a bad hair day."" She pouts, she swishes, she glowers like she's auditioning for a melodramatic TikTok, but menace? Nah. She's so obviously the fairest that the magic mirror must've been drunk to pick Snow. The dwarves? Apparently, Disney forgot them in the CGI blender and hit ""low budget"" instead. The forest looks like a rejected PS2 game level, and the acting? It's like everyone was reading their lines off a teleprompter set to ""bored."" The songs might've been catchy if I hadn't already checked out to plan my grocery list. This isn't a movie, it's a cry for help from a studio that lost the plot, the charm, and apparently the entire budget on Snow White's over-saturated wardrobe. Save your money and watch paint dry; at least that's free and won't lecture you about its aspirations.",1/10
"Listen gents, I will save your time. Do not watch this film. At all. Save yourselves before you will fall into her hands and the filth of the film that they have produced. The film is beyond saving and it was ridiculously horrible that the God's green earth what be able to reverse it's timeline to save this film.

I guarantee you that there's multiple realities across the multiverse that not 1 universe has this film highly rated, it is inevitable and it will always remain 1/10.

I wish there was 0/10 if ever existed. But sadly it is not there unfortunately.

But Disney, if you want your films to be top notch, I suggest you to start reviewing everyone's comments.",1/10
"The casting is awful. Rachel Zegler does not capture the charm of Snow White, and her performance is bland. Gal Gadot, as the Evil Queen, lacks the presence and menace needed for the role. The rest of the cast is just as disappointing, making the film even worse.

Visually, the movie is unimpressive. The CGI looks bad, the costumes feel uninspired, and the overall atmosphere lacks the enchantment that made the original so special. Instead of improving on the classic, Disney has turned it into a forgettable, soulless mess.

This is easily one of the worst Disney remakes ever. If you love Snow White, avoid this film, it will only ruin the magic.",1/10
"Entire movie is unoriginal, uninspired and boring. Acting is subpar and the plot is a snooze fest. This movie is an insult to the original and shouldn't have existed in the first place. The soulless remakes of old Disney movies have no passion nor feeling. Snow white is the prime example of an effortless cash grab, with problematic people behind the film on top of that. Theaters are empty and hardly any tickets are sold. This movie's (if you can even call it that) downfall is the result of laziness and money hungry people who have no creativity. I feel awful for the actual artists who had to work on this dumpster fire. Leave old films alone and make something original.",1/10
"Disney really took a gamble with Snow White (2025), but it looks like it didn't pay off. Between the controversy surrounding the casting, the drastic changes to the classic story, and the mixed performances, it feels like another case of a remake nobody asked for. Instead of capturing the timeless magic of the original, this adaptation seems to have lost its charm in an attempt to modernize a beloved tale. The visuals may be stunning, but that can't make up for weak writing and uninspired direction. The heart and soul of Snow White are missing, leaving audiences with a forgettable and unnecessary remake. The absence of the iconic dwarfs, the forced political undertones, and the lackluster chemistry between the lead characters make this one of Disney's weakest live-action adaptations to date. It's yet another example of a studio trying too hard to reinvent a story that was already perfect as it was. 1/10.",1/10
"Snowwhite is a breathtaking reinterpretation of the classic tale, blending stunning visuals, strong performances, and an engaging narrative. From the very first scene, the film immerses you in a beautifully crafted world, with cinematography that feels both grand and intimate.

The lead actress delivers a compelling performance, bringing depth and nuance to Snowwhite, making her more than just a fairytale figure. The supporting cast is equally strong, with the antagonist being particularly memorable. The film balances emotion, action, and a touch of humor, making it an enjoyable experience from start to finish.

Beyond the storytelling, the production design and score elevate the film even further. Every detail, from costume choices to set designs, adds to the immersive experience. The music complements the film perfectly, enhancing key moments without overwhelming them.

Overall, Snowwhite is a must-watch, whether you're a fan of the original story or just looking for a well-crafted fantasy film. It stays true to the essence of the classic while bringing enough freshness to make it feel new. A well-deserved 10/10!",10/10
"A remake of a classic. It was clear that Disney invested heavily in the film - the effects are impressive, and the slight changes make it somewhat more engaging. However, it's a musical... and I couldn't help but wonder: Why did they have to sing every seven minutes? Completely unnecessary.

Additionally, the final part of the movie could have had a more developed storyline. Everything felt rushed and unfinished. Unfortunately, it's a no from me, but I can understand why some people might enjoy it. I'm also not entirely sure if the actors accurately represent 16th-century Germany... 4/10 from me.",4/10

"What can I say about Disney's 2025 Snow White? It's a live-action letdown that completely misses the heart of the story. Snow White is supposed to win over the kids-and honestly, everyone watching-with real kindness, sweetness, and gentleness that leaps off the screen. That's the magic of the original. But here? It just didn't happen.

Rachel Zegler's take on Snow White feels like a swing and a miss. She's got the voice, I'll give her that, but there's no warmth or sparkle to pull you in. I wanted to feel that gentle, genuine spirit shining through, the kind that makes you root for her, but it never came across. Instead, she's just... there, going through the motions like she's reading a script instead of living it. The kids deserve a hero who radiates that classic Snow White charm, and Zegler doesn't deliver.

The rest of the movie doesn't help either. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is cold and forgettable, and the CGI dwarfs look like they stumbled out of a bad video game. The visuals are slick but soulless, and the story stumbles around without focus. But it's Snow White herself that sinks it. If the main character can't make you feel her kindness on the other side of the screen, what's the point?

This remake left me unmoved and honestly kind of bored. Skip it and stick to the animated classic-it's got the heart this one forgot.",1/10
Main character is hard to watch. The effects were fine and Gal Gadot was fine. The way the script was changed and the dwarf characters I did not find entertaining just annoying. Just hard when the original was a classic this is not. Will only be remembered for the bad parts and controversy. I am sure there were people who would have enjoyed a live action version but stayed away due to negative press and even some people that went just to support it even though it wasn't a movie they would typically see. Either way if you have seen the original this movie does not stand on its own. If I had never seen the original I may have given it a slightly higher score but the main character and undertones and dwarf characters do not land with me.,3/10
"So, Disney's latest live-action ""Snow White"" is out, and let me tell you, it's a complete disaster. The visuals are just off, like they tried to make it look cool but ended up with something that looks like a bad video game. And those CGI dwarfs? Creepy as heck, not charming at all. The new songs? Forgettable, like they didn't even try. The story tries to be modern but ends up being a mess, and Snow White herself, played by Rachel Zegler, comes off as super naive and weak. The casting choice for Snow White has caused a lot of drama, which is just sad because it overshadows the movie itself. Zegler's performance is flat, and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen? More like a fashion disaster than a villain.. It's got no heart, no charm, and definitely no magic. Skip this one, seriously.",1/10

"I went into this movie expecting at least a fresh take on the beloved classic, but what I got was a complete train wreck. This version of Snow White strips away everything that made the original story magical and replaces it with a soulless, uninspired mess.

First, there's no prince-one of the most iconic elements of the story. Instead, the film feels like it's trying so hard to be different that it forgets why people loved Snow White in the first place. The heart, the romance, the fairy-tale wonder-completely gone.

Then there's the casting. Snow White, who is supposed to be ""the fairest of them all,"" doesn't embody that in any way, while the Evil Queen is stunningly beautiful but somehow doesn't believe she is. It's a bizarre contradiction that makes the entire premise fall apart.

The writing is painfully bad, the pacing drags, and the changes feel forced rather than organic. It's like the filmmakers had no respect for the original story or its audience. If you're a fan of the classic Snow White, do yourself a favor and skip this. It's a waste of time and an insult to a timeless fairy tale.",1/10

"Snow White is a Disney film directed by Marc Webb. I was already at low expectations before I even saw this movie, I tried giving it a chance when I went in theaters. But it still wasn't good. I appreciate the work out into it and I liked the people who were involved in it. The cinematography was excellent and the music was well produced by Benj Pasek & Justin Noble Paul, and the CGI was EXCELLENT! But the story however felt bland and boring, and it some parts felt like they didn't even try. The close-up shots in certain parts of the movie was awkward, and the some of the acting was a bit off. And it still goes to show that sometimes live action isn't better because it will never capture the same feeling as the original. Another problem was that the CGI for the animals felt too cartoony, and I honestly wasn't a big fan of it. And the casting wasn't that great, the elves and queen were well casted and were perfect! But the actress for Snow White was bad, she didn't really look like the original... for me at least. I'm not saying she shouldn't act again, I'm just saying that she wasn't the right one for Snow White. Another thing I should clarify is that I know that the film isn't for me, it's for the younger audience. But a film for kids should also be for the adults/family.

In conclusion, the film failed to live expectations, mediocre acting, and bland story. 4.5/10.",4/10
"The film intended to adapt Snow White to more contemporary times, and it wasn't easy given that the animated film tells the story in a traditional way. There was no way to recreate it that would change this because the traditional style used is part of the animated film's identity. The choice was to be a loose adaptation of the Brothers Grimm tale, using elements from the animated film. The film has identifiable elements from the animated version, but a more distinct story that doesn't depend on the animated film. It's a much more independent story, but it maintains some very important aspects of the original tale.

Rachel stumbles at times, but her acting and singing are admirable. Because Snow White's name has always been linked to the character's appearance, redesigning the character wasn't going to be easy. Throughout the adaptations, the character has been fairly respected, with actresses who sometimes conformed to Snow White's beauty standard. Likewise, redesigning Snow White wasn't impossible, either her name or the meaning of her given name could have been changed. Here, they did the latter by linking Snow White's name to the time of her birth during the snowy season. In the 1997 adaptation, Snow White decided to summon courage and confront her stepmother. It was here that Snow White would evolve in subsequent adaptations, becoming a more heroic girl. In ""Mirror Mirror"" and ""Snow White & The Huntsman,"" we see this princess becoming a warrior to confront the queen and free her kingdom from tyranny. This 2024 adaptation follows the same formula, and unlike what audiences have said, here Snow White is driven by honor and concern for her people, just like in the adaptations exemplified above.

Something that has always been essential to the character's core is kindness and gentleness. This has been present in many of the different versions of Snow White, and her pure heart is what has always characterized her. This is also present in this film because Snow White cares for her people and the people around her. Here, Snow White resorts to more stoicism and is a force that acts more through the spirit than the body itself. Beyond giving new meaning to the name, the film does the same with the concept of beauty. When the mirror says that Snow White is the fairest, it doesn't refer to her look, but to the purity of her heart.

Gal Gadot plays Queen Grimhilde, who is serious most of the time and sometimes overacts, but maintains the character's characteristic jealousy and coldness. It may have left something to be desired, but it's a version that, in terms of design and personality, closely resembles the image Grimhilde has had since Disney's animated version. Although the film doesn't explicitly show it, it's easy to see that Grimhilde is overly obsessed with being the only beautiful woman in the entire kingdom. Something that has been present in many adaptations.

The seven dwarfs were redesigned as gnomes, partially respecting the look and personality of their animated counterparts. The downside is that the CGI gave them a somewhat bizarre appearance that could have been corrected with better rendering. Here, the prince was reimagined as a Robin Hood-style bandit named Jonathan. Although he is a somewhat careless man, he plays a role as Snow White's companion and future lover. Jonathan is a noble man who believes in justice and a rebel with ideas that are very compatible with Snow White's. The two make a good duo and have a chemistry that makes love blossom between them.

After all this, it's a very well-functioning adaptation and a stunning fantasy film. Regardless, the animated film remained difficult to dethrone, but this version of Snow White is a good and satisfying film. My final rating for this film is 9/10.",9/10
"Man oh man... I am an avid film lover. 100s of movies I have written reviews on. Thousands of films I have seen. I always watch new movies because I'm a damn of the art. But this, this is not art. I grew up watching Disney movies and have been left disappointed several times since about 2020. I have watched most movies anyway even tho I know it's not gonna be the best because I am a fan of films. This is the first time I felt an internal irritation, this feeling that I neeeded to get up in leave, it was like a itch I needed to scratch badly, and that itch was the exit door. Minus the fact that I was the only one in the theater i frequently let out sighs and grunts which I never do no matter how bad it is. This Rachel actress is unbearable. Where are the real dwarfs? Why is the queen much prettier than the princess? (The roles should've been switched) why is the prince just some side character to boost snow whites ego essentially. She pretty much just keeps him around as her yes man and has no real interest in him. I lay In bed at night more comfortable than ever because atleast I'm not stuck in that theater anymore. Im most disappointed that the financial implosion of this movie won't have any affect on Disney's trillions and won't stop them from making more garbage like this. Please Disney I beg you. Just stop making stuff all together since I don't think you can fix it anymore. Leave my childhood movies alone.

"I went into this movie hoping for a fresh take on a classic, but what I got was an uninspired mess that completely misunderstands what made Snow White special in the first place. The heart and soul of the original film are nowhere to be found. The characters lack depth, the dialogue feels forced, and the CGI is distractingly bad. Snow White herself is written in a way that makes her unrecognizable from the beloved character audiences have cherished for decades.

The film also feels more like a bland modern lecture than a timeless fairy tale. It strips away the charm, whimsy, and warmth that made the original a masterpiece. Even the music, once a defining element, is forgettable.

Disney needs to stop remaking classics if they can't respect their own legacy. This is just another soulless cash grab. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who loves the original.",2/10
"This film is an absolute disgrace. The actors deliver their lines with all the passion of a broken toaster, making every scene unbearable. The lead has zero charm, zero depth, and zero ability to act. The supporting cast? Completely useless. The script is a lazy, self-righteous mess that strips away all the magic of the original. The CGI is laughable, the sets are soulless, and the costumes look like a cheap school play. Worst of all, the film thinks it's profound, but it's just insufferable.

"Disney has decided to kill imagination by turning their beloved classics into soulless live-action remakes. Rachel Zegler they can never make me hate you. She has talent and charm, she can sing and she can belt. She's made for the stage but we're lucky we can watch her on the screen. Gal Gadot was a serious miscast, there is nothing of hers that feels in place here. She's hidden under this costume and she can't sing and still they gave her a lot to do. The whole movie suffers from a really badly written script. There are many ideas that they could have built more on, but sadly they chose to explore many, without really giving any of them the space to develope into something fresh or bold or beautiful. I didn't expect this to be a musical, most of the modern songs were really cringe worthy and felt like they don't belong in this world of ""Snow White"". The seven dwarfs honestly are an outrage, I really won't ever understand how this felt acceptable. Sadly there are many things that kill the joy in the movie, and the serious problem is the pacing and the plot that's all over the place. There are casting problems, and song problems, and fantasy problems and so ""Snow White"" will be shelved at the shelf of the really bad Disney remakes which lately has become really overcrowded.",4/10
"Don't watch it, waste of the time, Gadot's performance was full of overacting and lacking depth. The Evil Queen is supposed to be the embodiment of vanity, cruelty, and obsession. She's a character whose sinister presence looms over Snow White, creating tension and fear. Unfortunately, Gadot's version of the character never achieves this. Instead of exuding menace, she comes across as campy and cartoonish. Her exaggerated facial expressions, especially her constant eyebrow-raising, make it difficult to take her seriously. At times, she seems more like a comedic villain from a children's TV show than a dark, calculating sorceress.

A major issue with Gadot's performance is that she lacks the gravitas required for the role. She doesn't have the vocal authority to deliver lines with the weight they deserve. When she speaks, her lines sound unnatural and forced, as if she's reading them from a teleprompter rather than embodying the Queen's sinister essence. Her attempts at sounding menacing fall flat, and instead of being terrifying, she feels out of place.",1/10
"I would give this a 0 if I could. This film is a complete waste of time and money. The CGI dwarves look awful, like something from a low-budget game. The music is forgettable and uninspired.

It's clear the creators had no respect for the original work or its author. Every decision feels like an insult to fans. This isn't just a bad adaptation-it's a mockery.

The CGI looked awful too. The ""dwarfs"" or whatever they are now felt so outta place and looked like bad photoshop half the time. Nothing felt real, it was all just green screen vibes and fake looking sets.

Gal Gadot tried I guess, but the script gave her nothing to work with. Every scene she was in felt pointless. The music was forgettable, the dialogue was cringey, and there's literally no emotion in any of it.

I grew up loving this story, and this remake just felt hollow. It's like they stripped out anything fun or magical and replaced it with a bunch of generic messages and awkward lines. Whole thing felt more like a parody than a real movie. Wouldn't recommend.",1/10

Remake the classics by staying true to the original. And you know what, hire creative people and create NEW IP and do what you want with that.

"Disney's 2025 live-action Snow White remake is a misguided effort that dulls the magic of the original classic. Despite its $270 million budget, the film feels flat and lifeless, failing to recreate the charm that made the 1937 version iconic.

Rachel Zegler brings effort to the title role, but the script strips away Snow White's innocence in favor of a forced, modernized persona that lacks emotional depth. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is similarly underwhelming, missing the menace and charisma the role demands.

Visually, the film falters with uncanny CGI dwarfs that feel more like digital placeholders than characters, diminishing any sense of warmth or nostalgia. The soundtrack is equally disappointing-forgettable new songs and uninspired remakes of the classics add little emotional impact. As The New Yorker notes, the film fails to capture the soul of the original, while The New York Post calls it a ""pointless and awkward"" experience that quickly fades from memory.

Rather than breathe new life into a beloved tale, this remake drains it of its spirit. For those craving true fairy tale magic, the original Snow White remains the fairest of them all. I would have walked out, but I was hoping it would get better.",1/10

"Disney's latest live-action remake of Snow White is anything but magical. Instead, it's a poorly rendered CGI mess that makes you wonder if the studio outsourced half the film to an old video game studio.

Then there's Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen-yikes. Painfully off. Every sneer, line delivery, and dramatic pose feels like she's auditioning for a perfume ad rather than channeling one of Disney's most iconic villains. Menacing? Not even close.

This remake is proof that some classics are better left untouched. Save yourself the disappointment and stick with the 1937 animated version-it's far more enchanting than this CGI-filled misfire.",1/10
"I went into this movie with low expectations, but somehow, it managed to be even worse than I imagined. From start to finish, the Snow White live-action remake is bland and completely misses the charm of the original.

I've always loved the original Snow White because, at its core, it's a story about innocence, kindness, and the simple dream of finding love and belonging. Snow White was just 14 years old, a girl who wanted a quiet life, adored animals, and longed for acceptance, something I deeply related to during my teenage years. Her purity and gentle nature made her an endearing character, someone you wanted to protect and root for.

But this live-action SW completely strips away that essence. Instead of an innocent and kind-hearted girl, we get a smug and arrogant version of Snow White, far from the character who should represent youth, warmth, and sincerity. Her simple dream is replaced with forced, modern messaging that lacks any real heart. It's not just a bad adaptation, it's a complete betrayal of what made the original so special!!!",1/10

Instead, I got a messy hodgepodge of bad decisions, subpar visual effects, and a total lack of respect for the story that charmed generations.

Rachel Zegler, in the titular role, feels completely detached from Snow White's essence. Her performance is stiff, lacking the warmth and innocence that defined the character. The attempt to turn the princess into a modern, independent figure sounds good on paper, but on screen, it comes off as forced and uninspired. Gal Gadot, as the Evil Queen, should have been a highlight, but her delivery is theatrical in the worst way-more cartoonish than menacing.

The CGI effects are another disaster. The seven dwarfs, now digitally animated creatures, look like they were pulled from a cheap video game, not a $270 million Disney production. Their scenes are cringe-worthy, and the absence of real actors in these roles feels like an insult to the spirit of the original story. The script is a chaotic mess, filled with pointless moments and dialogue that makes you wonder who greenlit this.

It all feels like a cash grab riding on nostalgia, offering nothing of value in return. It's a mockery of Disney's legacy and a complete waste of time. 1/10-and that's only because I can't give it less.""",1/10
"I'm somewhat perplexed why a $270 million budget couldn't stretch a story with 2.5-hour potential into more than just 90 minutes of runtime. The direct consequences of cramming musical numbers into an insufficient duration manifest as narrative pacing collapse, underdeveloped character arcs, and logical inconsistencies throughout. While the vocal belting sections demonstrate technical prowess, Gal Gadot's musical sequences might rank among this year's most cringe-inducing cinematic moments - one can't help but plead ""Your Majesty, stop this obsession with maintaining your beauty!""

What truly shines are the thoughtful adaptations that breathe new spirit into classic lore. Rachel Zegler's flawless vocals validate her destiny as a musical film icon, evident since her breakthrough in The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. She embodies the quintessential Disney princess with authentic charm - singing to her reflection in the water, making wishes with unwavering optimism. While individual preferences for Disney princesses may evolve over time, Rachel's portrayal proves there will always be audiences enchanted by this timeless archetype.",1/10
"Snow White 2025 was a real shock to me, having grown up loving the classic fairy tale. I walked into the theater with sky-high expectations, hoping to see an inspired remake that honored what made the original so appealing. Instead, I got a mess that not only strayed from the source material but also seemed to intentionally blaspheme it. This was not the Snow White I knew and loved - this was something else entirely, something that made me wonder if Disney even cared about the value of childhood memories anymore. From the start, the film confused me with its character development. The Wicked Witch, who was a symbol of pride and beauty in the original story, now appears in all her glory, but is jealous of an ugly Snow White? I'm not even sure if I should call her ""Snow White"" anymore, because that name just doesn't seem right. In the original, Snow White is the embodiment of purity and natural beauty, but here, she's turned into a bland, lifeless character who leaves no impression other than being confusing. This strange reversal not only takes away from the story's meaning, but also makes the relationship between the two main characters absurd and unconvincing. The plot is twisted beyond recognition. One of the highlights of the original was how Snow White found comfort and friendship with the seven dwarfs, who worked hard in the quarries. But in Snow White 2025, everything is turned upside down in an unpleasant way. Snow White stays at the dwarfs' house not to share work or build meaningful relationships, but to sing and dance? Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs, who have been working hard all day, return home only to find themselves with a pile of chores that Snow White seems to have left untouched. Seriously, what is going on? Not only is this change absurd, it completely destroys the spirit of unity and mutual support that was at the heart of the story. The other unnecessary changes in the film only add to my disappointment. I understand that a remake needs to be creative to suit a modern audience, but what Disney did here was not creative, but destructive. They added unnecessary details, changed the characters' personalities arbitrarily, and ignored the core values that made Snow White such a timeless work. I can't help but feel that the production team tried too hard to refresh the story, but ended up turning it into something alien, lacking the soul of the original. As a Snow White fan since I was a child, I feel betrayed. Not only did the film disappoint me, but it also made me worry about the future of other classics that Disney might touch. My childhood memories - afternoons spent watching the 1937 animated version over and over again, singing along to the cheerful songs, and daydreaming about a fairytale world - are now tainted by this 2025 version. I cannot understand why Disney chose this path, instead of honoring the legacy they have built over generations. In short, Snow White 2025 is a disaster that is not worth the time. Not only does it fail to convey the spirit of the original story, but it also insults loyal fans like me. Disney, please stop. Stop ruining our childhoods. Let Snow White and our beautiful memories rest in peace.",1/10
"Horrible acting from Gal Gadot - talentless actresses like her shouldn't be allowed screen time. Didn't even bother watching the entire movie. If Disney is going to remake the classics maybe stick to the story, you don't have to reinvent the wheel. Also better casting is a must - big fail in this one. Gal gadget's mediocre performance is a testament that you should actually cast the leading actor for the role rather than just hand out the roles willy-nilly. Overall a disappointing experience. At this point I'm running out of things to say I just want to post my review and hopefully deter people from spending money and time on this.",1/10

"I went in expecting nothing and I was still disappointed. The plot was a mess, so many characters were introduced only for them to never have plot relevance, the CGI is nightmare fuel. There were so many points in the film where its obvious that they had an idea that they wanted to do only for it to go absolutely no where. And dont even get me started on the acting, Gal Gadot has the exact same delivery and emotion on every line to the point where watching her performance becomes infuriating, and the other acotors dont fare much better. To give you an idea on how much I dislike the movie, I made an IMDB acount just to tell people DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!",1/10
"Here's a refined version of your review with a strong and clear tone while keeping the frustration intact:

---

I don't usually write reviews, but this movie was so bad that I had to recover my IMDb password just to warn people: Do. Not. Watch.

Gal Gadot's performance was beyond disappointing-just awful. And as for the actress playing Snow White... I have no words. The casting choices were a disaster, and the acting felt completely unprofessional. It's frustrating to see such an iconic story ruined by a cast that seems utterly miscast.

This movie isn't just bad-it's infuriating. A complete waste of time. Stay away.",1/10
"This movie was horrible. Absolutely the biggest flop in history. Even my 4-year-old daughter, who usually loves anything with princesses, was bored out of her mind. I can't believe I actually spent money on this mess-it felt like a total waste of my time and life.

Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen? Terrible casting. She looked like she was trying way too hard and somehow still came off completely flat. Zero menace, zero charm, just cringe.

The story was bland, the acting wooden, and whatever magic Disney usually brings to the table was completely missing here. Save yourself the pain-skip this one.

0/10. Do not recommend.",1/10
"I haven't watched the movie, but I have a 7yo niece who was excited to go and see her favorite animated movie on a big screen. I took her and her mom, my sister to the cinema, cause she also grew up with that cartoon classic. I was browsing the mall and not even 40 minutes in, they called me that they are out. The sad part is that my niece was the one who wanted to leave, because i quote ""it was boring"". When you have a 7yo kid, who was excited to enter the movie hall, to see her favorite film and not even halfway through, she wants to leave, because it's boring, it should be rated at lower than 1 star.",1/10
"If you thought Hollywood had already hit rock bottom, think again - the new ""Snow White"" (2025) manages to dig even deeper. This isn't just a bad movie; it's a masterclass in how to ruin a classic, trample on its legacy, and insult audiences who just wanted a good story.

Let's start with the plot. The original fairy tale? Forget it. The magic? Completely erased. Instead, we get a painfully predictable and dull script that desperately tries to be ""modern"" but ends up feeling like a poorly written fanfiction. The moral messaging is so heavy-handed that even kids will roll their eyes.

The acting? Absolutely atrocious. The lead actress looks like she was forced into the role-zero emotion, zero charisma, zero effort to actually embody the character. The supporting cast? Either erased or replaced with such bland personalities that you'll forget they existed the moment you leave the theater.

Visuals and CGI? It's as if the budget was spent on anything but decent animation. The CGI is so awful it feels like a relic from the early 2000s. Even the natural environments look artificial, and the supposed ""magic"" is completely lifeless.

And finally, the worst part - the film's tone. Instead of a charming, whimsical fairy tale, we get a pretentious, preachy lecture that sucks the joy out of every scene. It's like sitting through a two-hour sermon instead of watching an actual story unfold. The heart and soul of the original have been completely lost.

Final verdict: If you have two hours to spare, do something more productive-like watching paint dry. That would be far more entertaining than this soulless, uninspired, and downright terrible film.",1/10
"To me growing up Snow White wasn't really a princess I loved, she was just bland to me. She was likely my least favorite one. The movie kinda did her a little justice but not that much.

Rachel Ziegler singing is actually amazing, probably one of the best things to come out of this movie. She tried her best in this so I'm gonna give some credit.

Gal Gadot, there's not much to say, I feel every movie I've seen her in her acting is always so emotionless, but I know Hollywood they only go for beauty these days not talent.

I hope the kids enjoyed this and the one's who it was made for felt represented in a way.

Also from the press photos they could've done a little better styling wise.",4/10
"What is even the point of naming this movie under the title snow white when her whole personality was changed and there wasn't even a prince... not mentioning the horrible casting for snow white. Snow white is for the feminine girls, who aren't really interested in being a fighter like mulan, not saying any of them is bad but the whole point is just missing. They even changed the song track, the acting is not really doing it for me either. I absolutely hated how this movie was adapted to real life. Disney is a million dollar company and no way they are serving us a whole lot of nothing, they can do alot better than whatever this is.",1/10
"This remake is completely unnecessary. It strips away everything magical about the original and replaces it with bad CGI, bland performances, and a forced modern twist that doesn't work. Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks charm, and Gal Gadot's Evil Queen isn't intimidating at all. The dwarfs look bizarre, making their scenes feel awkward and unnatural.

Despite Disney's massive budget, the movie feels cheap and soulless. It fails to capture the heart of the classic and doesn't offer anything new worth watching. If you loved the original, skip this one.

So to sum it up a Boring, Messy Remake No One Asked For.",1/10

"Didn't stick to the original and made a worse version not even worthy of 1 star. The empty theatres signify the loud message from the public.

Disney's 2025 Snow White completely deviates from the charm and magic of the original, delivering a soulless and uninspired adaptation that feels more like a cash grab than an honest attempt to honor the classic. The characters are poorly developed, and the changes to the narrative feel forced and unnecessary.

Audiences have clearly voiced their disappointment, as reflected by the empty theaters and overwhelmingly negative reception. This version misses the mark so badly that it doesn't even deserve a single star. Disney needs to realize that altering classic tales beyond recognition only alienates the loyal fan base that once eagerly supported their films.",1/10
"I recently attended a screening of Disneys live-action remake of Snow White 2025 and unfortunately found it to be a disappointing experience. Rachel Zegler, known for her role in West Side Story, portrays Snow White. Her performance lacked the depth and charm that made the original character so beloved. Gal Gadot, famous for Wonder Woman, takes on the role of the Evil Queen. While she brings a certain presence to the screen, her portrayal felt more glamorous than menacing, diminishing the characters iconic villainy.

Andrew Burnap plays Jonathan, a new character introduced as Snow Whites love interest. His addition to the story felt unnecessary and did little to enhance the plot. The Seven Dwarfs, voiced by actors such as Jeremy Swift Doc and Andrew Barth Feldman Dopey, lacked the distinct personalities that made them memorable in the original film.

The musical numbers, a crucial element of any Disney film, were underwhelming. Zeglers singing, despite her musical background, failed to capture the magic and emotion of the original songs. The new compositions by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, known for their work on La La Land, felt out of place and did not resonate.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some scenes are beautifully shot, the overuse of CGI, especially in depicting the dwarfs, detracts from the overall experience.

Overall, this adaptation of Snow White fails to capture the enchantment and timelessness of the original, leaving audiences longing for the magic that once was.",1/10
"It's SO bad the casting sucks the acting sucks just eww my children wouldn't even watch it and the casting is so bad wouldn't recommend at all they really needed better casting and everything overall is just not worth it or good to watch. The CIG is all over the place, if you are unemployed and hate urself watch it, the face expression when she sings or even talk is baddddd like wth are u doing i swear kids could've done so much better, Nobody has to watch this and go through the horrors I HATED this movie with my whole heart really never hated something more in my life wouldn't recommend at all!",1/10
"I was really excited to watch the new ""Snow White,"" but unfortunately, it fell flat for me. The story was weak and didn't stay true to the essence of the beloved original. The characters lacked development and depth, making it hard to connect with them.

The performances were average at best, and there was no chemistry between the lead characters. While the visual effects were impressive, it wasn't enough to save the film from its poor script.

If you're looking for a movie that captures the spirit of the original story with a fresh twist, I would recommend skipping this one. It had so much potential, but the execution was disappointing.",1/10
"Never before have I regretted watching a movie more. Childhood memories? Yeah, if you still have those DO NOT ruin them with this utter waste of resources.

Mirror mirror on the wall, have you ever rooted so hard for a poisoned apple? Holy...

How did they allow this to even come out? Walt is rolllling in his grave right now. Even Bob the Builder can't fix this. But hey, kudos to Disney for making a movie that absolutely nobody will pirate. I guess that's an accomplishment in this day and age.

Anywho, if you havent seen this yet, I implore you to spend your time/money on quite literally anything else.",1/10
"I could not be bothered to watch the film in its entirety. I left half way through. Dont be like me. Don't bother going at all, if you want to save your braincells for something important.

Another exhaustingly awful, pointless remake. Disneys butchered a classic for no reason other than to pander to modern-day nonsense.

From what I saw, the songs weren't too bad.... but they weren't good either. The plot was all over the place and the theatre was almost empty, which should have been a warning sign to begin with.

One of the dullest acting performances from Gal Gadot I have ever had the misfortune of seeing.

The original danced with charm and grace, this abomination trips over its own shoelaces and blames the floor.",1/10

"Shouldn't of been made. It isn't the same as the old one. Remakes of classic Disney films are never the same. And the casting isn't good. She doesn't have any resemblance to Snow White and the dwarves are off putting. It could've been so much better. It's not surprising it has so many low ratings, and she has talked bad about the original snow white film so why would they even cast her for a remake it's kind of disrespectful and like she doesn't even care. I would not recommend this movie to a friend. 0/10. Rooted for the Apple to be honest!!! Waste of money and time and energy and a whole movie.",1/10
"I suspect that MANY of these reviews are written out of pure spite by people who haven't seen the movie. The first review I read criticized Snow White's hair, when the reason why it looks so bad was made obvious early in the movie. For all of the clueless haters out there, it was intentional. You don't deserve more than that.

I saw it yesterday and absolutely loved it!

In contrast, the original movie is now very archaic, both in style and in the storytelling. Personally, the original Snow White's voice really grates on my nerves. She reminds me of some sort of Betty Boop character. In the original version, Snow White is basically a victim, who is rescued by her ""true love,"" with whom she has not even had a simple conversation. To be blunt, she is not much of a role model.

This interpretation, building upon the original structure, is much more complex, full of depth, and Snow White is a much stronger lead now, as is her love interest, Jonathan. They are both taking an active role in pushing back against the evil queen to restore their once-happy kingdom. Rachel (such a beautiful voice) and Andrew were relatable and made for a great couple. Gal Gadot did a great job as the very, very evil stepmother/queen. And I loved the expanded role of the dwarfs, especially Dopey, of course!

I thought the visuals were beautiful, and enjoyed most of the music. I was already a big fan of composers Pasek and Paul (The Greatest Showman, Smash, La La Land, 2019 live action Aladdin).

I believe that this updated version will be much more appealing to kids (especially little girls). I hope that they will take to heart the four words on Snow White's heart pendant: ""Fearless, Fair, Brave, True."" And for adults who are feeling nostalgic for Disney fairytales, I hope that this movie brings you some joy!",9/10
"This movie was awful, absolutely awful. Terrible casting and actresses. The casting choices for Snow White were particularly disappointing, as they seemed more focused on star power than on finding actors who truly embodied the characters. The lead actress, while popular, lacked the charm and innocence that the role of Snow White requires. Instead of bringing the beloved character to life, her performance felt forced and unconvincing, leaving audiences disconnected from the story.

Moreover, the supporting cast did little to elevate the film. The dwarfs, who are essential to the original tale's charm, were portrayed in a way that felt more like caricatures than genuine characters. The casting of well-known actors in these roles did not translate into memorable performances; instead, it felt like a missed opportunity to showcase lesser-known talent who could have brought authenticity and depth to the characters.

The chemistry between the cast members was also lacking. In a fairy tale, the relationships between characters are crucial, and viewers need to feel a genuine connection. Unfortunately, the interactions between Snow White and the prince felt awkward and devoid of any real emotion. Their romance, which should have been a central theme, came across as rushed and superficial, making it hard for the audience to invest in their journey.

Additionally, the film attempted to introduce a more modern take on the story, but this approach only highlighted the shortcomings of the casting. The decision to cast actors who fit a particular mold rather than those who could authentically portray their roles resulted in a disjointed narrative. The film struggled to balance contemporary themes with the classic fairy tale elements, and the casting choices only exacerbated these issues.

The dialogue, too, suffered due to the poor casting decisions. The actors seemed unable to deliver the lines with the necessary conviction, making even the most poignant moments feel flat. The film's attempts at humor fell flat as well, as the comedic timing was off, largely due to the actors' inability to fully inhabit their roles. It's clear that casting is not just about finding familiar faces; it's about finding the right fit for the story being told.

In a film that relies heavily on its characters, the casting failures had a ripple effect on every aspect of the production. The audience's ability to suspend disbelief and immerse themselves in the story was severely hindered by the lackluster performances. Instead of being captivated by a magical world, viewers were left feeling like they were watching a poorly executed play.

Furthermore, the film's marketing heavily emphasized its star-studded cast, leading to heightened expectations that were ultimately not met. The promotional material suggested a film that would be both enchanting and entertaining, but the reality was far from that. The disconnect between the marketing and the actual performances only added to the disappointment.

Ultimately, the casting choices in Snow White were a significant factor in the film's failure to resonate with audiences. The misalignment between the actors and their characters created a barrier that prevented viewers from fully engaging with the story. It serves as a reminder that casting is a crucial element of filmmaking, one that can make or break a project. In this case, the poor casting decisions overshadowed any potential the film may have had, leaving audiences with a sense of regret for what could have been.

In conclusion, the new Snow White film is a prime example of how critical casting is to the success of a movie. The lack of suitable actors in key roles led to a disjointed narrative, weak character development, and an overall failure to capture the magic of the original tale. Viewers are left hoping that future adaptations will learn from these mistakes and prioritize casting choices that truly honor the beloved characters and stories they aim to portray.",1/10
"Straying too far from the classic story, with significant changes to the characters and theme. The movie is a total letdown. It tries so hard to be different that it completely loses what made the original special. The story feels forced, and the changes don't add anything good. Snow White doesn't even act like the classic character-she's more dull than inspiring. The dialogue is awkward, and the movie lacks the magic and heart of the original. Plus, all the controversy surrounding it makes it hard to enjoy. It looks nice, but that's about it. Overall, it's just another remake that nobody really asked for.",1/10
"They had so many things. They could have done right. So many things. They could have done better. So many people they could have made. Actually, real people not CGI. But they chose their path. Gonna let them know that didn't like it.

And the everything on this feels so fake and feels like a child's movie. And if this was made for children, good for them. But if it wasn't made for children, and you know, was a remake, a live-action remake for those adults that enjoyed the original, it was, frankly, a travesty.

So Disney, I commend you. I have seen worse, but few and far between. End of late. Ones that come close are all from you.",1/10
"I can't even bring words together of how dissatisfied and disappointed I am with Disney...I mean come on guys. The movie that brought them to life is how they crumble. Seriously don't watch this movie, it will never be worth anyone's time. The acting from Gal Gadot is probably one of if not the worst performance I've seen in a while. It's dry it's plain and adds absolutely nothing to the original. Snow white used to be one of my favourite classic movies so I can't help but feel hurt by this ""remake"". The charm, originality and just over move is bad. Save your money and go home, watch the original.",1/10
"Another live remake bites the dust.

Such a shame as it could've been so beautiful and iconic in every way. Lack of depth to the characters and lazy wardrobe choices too:

I won't give spoilers to the script but don't even bother getting excited about seeing the classic Snow White look with the bouncey dark hair in a bow- did so much budget go on the cgi animation that they couldn't afford some volumising hair mousse?

Lazy choices with the dwarves. Either make the whole thing animated and leave in the trusted hands of Pixar or hire 7 actors who can flurrish in the limelight. As I said, it's just a lazy shame.",1/10

She shouldn't have been picked for this role. Her acting lacked authenticity and character. Whoever picked her for this role should be fired. Would give 0 stars if possible. There are much better fits for this role. I took my family to the movie and everyone cried and soon as we saw her (including me). Can director's be more thoughtful of their choices for role in the future please? I expect Disney to provide a former apology for this absolute abomination and would like to see the movie pulled. Everyone should get a refund and we cannot allow this o be seen again I feel sorry for every person who has seen this. I created an account just to criticise this movie.,1/10
"Alright, buckle up buttercups, because watching the new Snow White (bless its cotton socks) is like watching paint dry... but the paint is CGI that looks like it was rendered on a potato. The ""magical creatures"" formerly known as dwarfs? Imagine Teletubbies had a rough night and then got shrunk in the dryer. Not exactly the charming companions we remember.

Snow White herself seems less ""fairest of them all"" and more ""mildly inconvenienced by everything."" And Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen? Honey, she's serving more ""confused influencer trying to be menacing"" than actual villainy. Her performance oscillates between ""smoldering stare"" and ""did I leave the oven on?"" The script feels like it was written by an AI that was only fed Disney marketing slogans and rejected TikTok trends. Prepare for groundbreaking lines like, ""Being kind is, like, totally powerful!"" The whole thing is less a magical fairytale and more a fever dream you have after eating too much cheese before bed. So, unless you enjoy unintentional comedy and questioning all your life choices, maybe skip this one and rewatch the cartoon. Your eyeballs will thank you.",1/10
"To start off I feel really bad for all of the little people that could of done amazing as the seven dwarfs. Yet they chose to replace real hardworking people with CGI that looks terrible.

The costumes also look like they have been grabbed for a Halloween shop and look so cheap. The colours are horrendous on Snows dress and the Evil Queens looks tacky with all the cheap looking beading on it.

They don't look anything like the original.

I've seen Rachel in the Hunger Games and her singing in that was amazing, but in this the songs were missing something from the orginal. They lacked the soul and voice of the original Snow White and sounded more pop music then classical Snow White.

The Evil Queen dialogue is also terrible. The actress doesn't even try to deliver the lines like she's confident. She sounds bored or tired and it takes away from the conversations.

Quite frankly this was Disney just trying to make a quick buck, but the public aren't silly.

Make new and original ideas instead of remaking the same thing and it getting worse each time you make it.",1/10
"I believe Disney should stop making remakes as well as casting overhyped actors/actresses. The screenplay seems same as that of every other movie they make, or rather, remake. It really is dull. It does not exactly pull you in.

Moreover, less use of CGI and casting better actors would be appreciated in all the movies they make.

When the film makers deviate from the original plot, they think they are creating something different and unique but that's not always true.

Also, I believe this remake was quite unnecessary. I could not watch it because I get bored easily. If a book or movie does not appeal to me in the first few lines/moments, I skip it altogether.",1/10
"After leaving the movie theater, walking through the crowd and seeing how people looked at me leaving the room that said SnowWhite, I felt just like Queen Cercei Lannister felt in Game of Thrones, walking through the crowd while the sparrow priestess ringing a bell screamed shame.

I'd never felt so embarrassed leaving a movie theater after watching a film. I got home and it was even worse because my wife said the money we spent on the movie theater could have been better spent on another movie or even rented something better online.

I would never trust Disney movies again.

That's all I have to say, I'm just ashamed.",1/10
"Some movies disappoint, but Snow White is in a league of its own. It takes a beloved classic and strips it of everything that made it charming, leaving behind a lifeless, awkward mess. The writing feels forced, the characters are forgettable, and the visuals-while polished-can't make up for the soulless execution. It's like they tried so hard to be different that they forgot to be good. If you love the original, do yourself a favor and pretend this one doesn't exist.

Disney should have just left this story in the vault where it belongs. Instead, they dug it up, set it on fire, and asked audiences to pay for the ashes.",1/10

Her hair looks just bad. They had the chance to explain many things in the plot but decided not to. Lazy screenplay, lazy characters without any depth. Don't waste your time and money.

Mediocrity.

Dwarfs are just ridiculous. Unbelievable, very poor cgi, just stupid. Prince was a characterless figure created in this movie just to stay closer to original, not to mention bad casting choice. Gal gadot was huge disappointment, I liked her before. Cringe.",1/10
"A film like Snow White relies heavily on the charm and authenticity of its heroine, but in this new version, the lead actress seriously lacks charisma. Far from reflecting the innocence and sweetness expected, her performance feels bland and emotionless. This choice weakens the entire film, making it hard to connect with the character. Moreover, her lack of chemistry with the other actors makes the interactions unconvincing. Even polished cinematography can't make up for this major flaw. An adaptation of this classic deserves a heroine who fully embodies the magic and emotion of the tale. Here, we're left disappointed.",1/10
"What a Garbage of a Movie.... Disgusting to watch. The Worst Movie I have watched this year.

Another Failed Remake of the Original Snow White Movie. Instead of enhancing the story, it strips away its charm and replaces it with a lifeless, forgettable adaptation. Disney had the chance to create something special, but we got another uninspired cash grab that fails to justify its existence. Especially the Performance of the Lead Actress is way worse than I thought. Fans of the original will likely leave the theater disappointed and frustrated, once again questioning why Disney insists on remaking its animated classics when the magic clearly isn't there.

Final Rating: 1/10 - A Dull, Unnecessary remake.

Original is way Better.",1/10

It bothers me a lot that in the original it was a love story, it's not THIS. All the movie was a solid 1/10, remake it. And actually make the princess fall in love w a prince and how it's supposed to be. Stop changing the plot of these movies, she isn't like mulan or merida, she is SNOW WHITE. Sweet, soft, caring and that wants to find the love of her life. Period.",1/10

Honestly I'm not sure if I want to know what the moral of the story was supposed to be.

"Its just plain bad. Everything. Just bad.

The new Snow White movie, a reimagining of Disney's classic animated tale, is a striking example of how even the most beloved stories can be misjudged when handed to the wrong creative team. While modern adaptations often try to add fresh perspectives or bring diverse interpretations to the table, this version falls short in almost every way, leaving fans of the original classic and newcomers to the story alike feeling underwhelmed.

First and foremost, the film's pacing feels rushed and disjointed. Where the original animated film had a magical, almost dreamlike quality to it, this new iteration is often plagued by awkward transitions between scenes, which disrupt any sense of flow or coherence. The plot, which should center around Snow White's coming-of-age journey, her escape from the evil queen, and the eventual rescue by her prince, is muddled with unnecessary subplots and awkward dialogue that seem to dilute the emotional core of the story. What should have been a fairy tale filled with wonder and fantasy comes off instead as a string of disconnected moments that fail to captivate.

The performances, unfortunately, don't fare much better. While the lead actress playing Snow White has undoubtedly been chosen for her star power, her portrayal feels lifeless and underwhelming. Rather than embodying the warmth, innocence, and charm that made Snow White such a relatable and beloved character in the original, this version feels distant, with little emotional depth. Even the scenes that should feel empowering or inspiring fall flat because of the lack of connection to her character's plight.

Perhaps one of the biggest letdowns is the reworking of the film's villain, the Evil Queen. In an attempt to modernize the character, the film reimagines her motivations in a way that feels out of place within the context of the classic tale. Instead of the malevolent, obsessive force of vanity and jealousy, this new Evil Queen feels more like a misunderstood figure, which detracts from the terrifying power of her presence. The film attempts to make her more human, but in doing so, it loses the dark allure that made her such an iconic antagonist.

Visually, the movie offers some stunning shots, but it's clear that the special effects often take priority over actual storytelling. Beautiful landscapes and CGI creatures are overused, filling the screen with eye candy that distracts from the story rather than enhancing it. It's as if the filmmakers were more concerned with showing off technical prowess than crafting an emotional narrative, and this leaves the audience with a hollow experience, no matter how pretty the visuals might be.

In terms of the music, the film tries to incorporate modern songs and styles, but this choice seems jarring and out of place. The original score, with its whimsical melodies, perfectly captured the tone of the classic Snow White, while the new soundtrack fails to evoke the same sense of nostalgia or wonder. The songs, while catchy, feel forced and often detract from the mood of the scenes, making them feel more like insertions rather than organic parts of the story.

Ultimately, this Snow White movie is a missed opportunity. It attempts to bring new ideas to the table but does so at the cost of the essence of the original tale. The result is a movie that feels directionless, emotionally flat, and ultimately forgettable. For those hoping for a faithful reimagining or a story that stands out on its own, this adaptation disappoints on both fronts.",1/10
"This live-action remake felt like a hollow shell of a classic. The forced humor fell flat, and the updated storyline lost the charm of the original. Visually, it was stunning, but the special effects couldn't save the weak script. Honestly, I spent half the movie wondering what the original creators would think of this mess. It's a skip for me, and a sad example of how not to reimagine a beloved fairytale. The expressions felt plastered on, like someone told them to smile but forgot to tell them why. It was almost painful to watcch the cast struggle with such unnatural dialogue. Every line delivery seemed stiff and calculated, devoid of genuine emotion. And the lead actress, oh boy, her performance felt like she was reading cue cards for the first time. The whole thing just felt incredibly forced.",1/10
"The film companies got sick and went crazy!? You are killing memorable movies/animation and characters. It was the most rubbish thing I've ever seen in my life.

When you want to combine something from the past with something from the future, you have to be very careful and cautious. Because even a slight deviation from the original and the original model that existed in the past can ruin the entire project. This is something that film companies apparently don't care about at all! They combine everything with other irrelevant things and try to feed the audience. Your film and animation viewers are not cows! We also have a little bit of brain.",1/10
"Disney's live-action *Snow White* is a trainwreck so bad it makes you wonder if the dwarves mined for talent and came up empty. Rachel Zegler sings like an angel but acts like she's auditioning for a coma, while Gal Gadot's Evil Queen hams it up so hard she's basically a walking ham sandwich. The CGI dwarfs look like they were designed by a drunk AI on a budget, and the new songs? Imagine elevator music rejecting its own existence. They ditched the prince for some rando bandit who's as charming as a wet sock, and the whole thing's so tacky it feels like a fairy tale told by a clearance rack at Walmart. This isn't a movie-it's a $200 million cry for help from a Disney that's clearly lost the plot and its dignity.",1/10

"Live action is supposed to replicate the cartoon version. I dont think that there is anything wrong witht woman showing her power through her feminine side and beeing savwd by the prince. Thats what princess in childs eyes means. Mulan represents strong woman so why change snow white to be like her if she has her own qualities. Its absurd that diney is trying to please mayority of population by trying to equalise man and women. Women have power and can show it without using force and rage. I dont like the actress they choose to play snow white because she is not white, scared of the cartoon and doesnt like it. So why did you apply for the role????",1/10
"Since the rating system on this site mandates selecting at least one star, the lowest possible score I can give is 1/10. However, this movie doesn't even deserve that single point. It's a complete disaster from start to finish-poorly written, badly acted, and visually uninspired. The plot, if you can call it that, stumbles along with no coherence or purpose, leaving you wondering why anyone bothered to make it. The characters are flat, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the pacing is agonizingly slow. It's not even ""so bad it's good""-it's just a waste of time that fails to entertain on any level. Avoid it at all costs; it's utterly irredeemable.",1/10
I took my niece. She kept talking about this. Well i must say ew nothing like the original and why are they using old names but remake to push there storys on kids. Just use a new name so the storys arnt mixed up The original story was fine..and i wish movies would go back to pratical effects this computer effects stuff is not creative at all. The little people dont go into backstorys. And like what happens about the witch house thing um best part of the original too. No flying monkeys and no Dancing lolipop gild too that was a good one so. Yea could have been way better with the money spent .,1/10
"The new Snow White movie fails to capture the magic of the original classic. The storyline is muddled and lacks the charm that made the 1937 version beloved. The pacing is off, and the characters are poorly developed. Snow White's character feels bland and underwhelming, overshadowed by a lackluster performance. The special effects try too hard to dazzle but end up feeling overdone. Overall, it's a disappointing reimagining that doesn't live up to the legacy of its predecessor, missing the heart and wonder fans cherished. Overall pretty crushing, don't watch it. Very lackluster performance by the main character.",1/10
"Wow... what did I just watch? This remake completely ruins everything that made the original Snow White special. The story is all over the place, trying way too hard to be modern and missing the whole point of a fairy tale. Snow White herself is just unlikable, and the dwarfs? Barely even in it, and when they are, they have none of the charm from the classic.

The CGI is overdone, making everything look fake instead of magical. Even the songs are forgettable, which is shocking for a Disney movie. It honestly feels like they made this just for the sake of remaking it, with no love or effort put in. Save your time and rewatch the original-at least that one has heart.",1/10

"I love Disney films, I don't mind the re-branded ones, but they always come out as slightly hollow, and lacking the charm and sense of wonder, which definitely blunders any chances of real success, wonder and even an Imaginary world. Now what Snow White fails to also deliver on the success of the original, this movie was really not that bad though, it did have it's wonderous charm, and a world and nice props and effects, artificial or not, it was lovely and colourful, and the effects for me gave it that spark, that image, that essence of life. Which lacks in many re-makes from the classical tales.

Zeglar, let's start with her. We'll the material wasn't much, but God damn can she act. She can sing, and as Snow White she put on a show for us, she excells in the role, she looks absolutely beutiful in that dress of hers, and whilst the songs weren't as catchy as the original, and the darker tone of the story, her music gave it a real breath of fresh air. And she was amazing in the role, her charm, charisma and notes makes her fun to watch on screen, as she was really something in that role.

Gadot-her role as the evil sorcerer was fine, nothing noteworthy and nothing that tops-the-scales. More or less just sort of their, and doing an alright job, not that awful. Her songs weren't all that cathcy, and the anti-climax was hollow and rushed through, but her performance was mered by her muffling at times, which would distract the audience.

The 7 Dwarfs-Actually, they look Hillarious, the dwarfs lit-up the show with some jokes, Narratives of people and other things. And motives, memories. And the dwarfs lit it light, they were the best part about the film, as when they were on their was magic, their was a sense of freedom, and they were all great to see on screen. Even if they did look like they were on a video game, which was videoooo cool, instead of just cool. Yes, they look absolutely Rediculous, I couldn't stop laughing.

The bad bits would be the longer duration, the props being like a stage play, but this movie really isn't 2.1 BAD, nope more better then you'd expect. The crashing and burning probably is the controversial things which could of been left out. Because the films biggest problem is the fact that it's sometimes too dark for kids, I Don't think the movie really knew it's audience, I'd say ages 10 and Upwards will heavily enjoy or be gutted with it's outcome, but no-way expressively bad.

I'd rate this a 5 because YES it has FLAWS, but it also has ALOT of FUN.",5/10
"Expanding on the initial statement, my consistent disappointment with Gal Gadot's performances extends beyond this particular film and permeates her overall filmography. Her vocal delivery frequently lacks the necessary inflection and dynamism to truly engage the audience, often presenting as a flat and monotonous drone that hinders the emotional resonance of her lines. This absence of vocal variation makes it challenging to fully invest in her characters and their experiences. Moreover, her portrayal of emotions often feels superficial and unconvincing. Whether the scene calls for joy, sorrow, or anger, the depth and nuance required to create a believable and impactful emotional connection with the viewer seem to be consistently missing. This latest role, unfortunately, has only served to solidify my long-held opinion regarding her limitations as an actress. The nuances and complexities that could have elevated the character were lost, further highlighting a fundamental lack of acting prowess.

Beyond the technical aspects of her performance, there is also a persistent sense of haughty arrogance that emanates from her on-screen persona. This perceived self-importance can be distracting and creates a barrier between the character and the audience, making it difficult to empathize or connect with her motivations. It often feels as though she is presenting rather than embodying the role. Furthermore, her on-screen presence appears to be plagued by an internal conflict, a kind of identity crisis that manifests in performances that are jarringly inconsistent. At times, she seems to overcompensate, resulting in exaggerated and theatrical portrayals that lack subtlety and realism. Conversely, there are moments where she appears underwhelming and detached, failing to command the scene or leave a lasting impression. This constant fluctuation between being over-the-top and surprisingly bland creates a disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience. The lack of a grounded and consistent characterization makes it impossible to fully immerse oneself in the narrative. In conclusion, considering her persistent struggles with vocal delivery, emotional depth, a perceived air of arrogance, and inconsistent character portrayals, I remain convinced that Gal Gadot's casting in this and other significant film projects has been a disservice to the potential of those stories and a source of ongoing disappointment for me as a viewer. Her limitations consistently detract from the overall quality and impact of the films she participates in.",1/10
"Disney's 2025 Snow White is a stunning reimagining that honors the classic while introducing a fresh, empowering vision. Under Marc Webb's direction, the film captivates with breathtaking visuals, a heartfelt story, and outstanding performances.

Rachel Zegler delivers a radiant and compelling Snow White, blending innocence with strength. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is mesmerizing, exuding both beauty and menace, making for a thrilling dynamic between them. Their interactions bring depth and intensity to the narrative.

The film's visuals are spectacular, seamlessly blending CGI with practical effects to create a magical yet immersive world. The enchanted forest and the dwarfs' cottage feel alive, adding to the wonder.

Balancing nostalgia with modern themes, Snow White (2025) is a cinematic triumph. It pays homage to the beloved original while standing as its own powerful story of self-discovery and courage. A must-watch for Disney fans and new audiences alike.",10/10
"It was a generally inoffensive but unnecessary remake. The controversies were overstated (making Zegler and her hot takes the most likely culprit in the film's poor numbers). One thing I'm pretty over is the weird direction that all of Disney's songwriting had taken. Some stuff is pretty good (it's all ""technically"" good), but there seems to be a straight line through Jasmine's new song in the Aladdin remake and all the ""girl I'm supposed to be"" songs of pretty much every Disney movie for the last 5-10 years. Disney music just isn't great anymore. I guess I'm in the minority, but I don't LIKE Lin Manuel Miranda's songwriting (I know he didn't write these, but his tone has infected everything). It's well done. And I don't like it. And that's how I feel about everything Disney is doing these days. For something to be basically well done and not be likeable seems to be an issue of tone, of trying to appeal to all the wrong instincts while abandoning some of the hallmarks of good storytelling. It's like they're making movies by committee, but the people on the committee don't like movies. Snow White (the movie) was more wholesome than I expected, but the climax wasn't climactic. It was...meh. Almost silly. There just seems to be a cultural influence through Disney lately that runs counter to the lives of the average movie goer, like they don't speak our language anymore. They're speaking over the heads of the public like they're being idealistic, but with ideals that we don't seem to share. Snow White was the least offensive in this regard of any Disney movies of late, but it still feels like something is getting lost in translation, like they're trying to say what they think we want to hear and they still don't understand it. If anything, it feels like the people who work at Disney and make their movies didn't grow up watching Disney movies. They're bringing some other cultural touchstones to bear in a playground that was built by people they don't understand or value, and it shows.",5/10

"After years of controversy, drama, multiple delays and reshoots, the live action remake of the 1937 Disney animated classic, Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs, is finally here. Seeing all the never-ending controversies and multiple reshoots, I didn't had high hopes for it and well.........let's just get into the review.

Starting with the positives. I like that they fleshed out Snow White's character more by giving her a proper backstory and an 'I Want' song and Rachel Zegler's luminous performance was easily the part about the movie. Her gorgeous singing and chemistry with the other actors was a delight to watch. Andrew Burnap as Jonathan was a pleasant surprise. He was hilarious and charming and his chemistry with Rachel is great. Out of the dwarfs, Dopey was the highlight and I like that they gave his character more depth and surprise twist. The other dwarfs were fun to watch (not their designs) as well, particularly Doc and Grumpy. The costume design and production design were beautiful, the visuals were whimsical and enchanting particularly the forest and the dwarfs' cottage and the CGI animals looked adorable.

But the movie has some glaring issues that I could not look past such as Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen. Her performance feels so flat, boring and uninteresting and is far inferior to her animated counterpart. Nor is she any good at singing either which is a shame because her solo number ""All Is Fair"" is actually kinda catchy but she just ruins it with her awful singing. It felt like she was just there to serve looks and nothing else. Then there's the CGI dwarfs. Oh my!! They looked so uncanny valley something straight out of the Polar Express animation which was so distracting. The new songs, though decent, do not mesh well with the old-timey tunes of the original and instead feel like generic broadway pop numbers. And the plot feels messy as it is muddled with so many story beats that it kinda falls apart. It seems to have an identity crisis as it tries to follow the original story while incorporating its own plot points instead of faithfully adapting the source material. The love story was very uninspired and lacked depth. There are so many new characters added who serve nothing to the plot (heck some doesn't even have any dialogues) and were completely unnecessary. Despite the runtime being under 2 hours it felt like the movie dragged on particularly during the second half thanks to the pacing.

Overall, Snow White suffers from a messy plot, Gal Gadot's terrible acting and the uncanny CGI dwarfs but Rachel Zegler's luminous performance and the enchanting visuals makes it a serviceable film. Though it certainly isn't the fairest one of all.",5/10
"Ok, so i watched the Snow White remake out of curiosity with my little niece (not a fan in general of these remakes that Disney keeps churning out) and... it's just ok, nothing else.

Let's start with the positives: Rachel Zegler gives her all with the material she's been given (especially her enjoyable rendition of ""Whistle While You Work"" that was delightful), the set design is gorgeous and some of the songs aren't that bad.

But unfortunately, i have to talk about the negatives: the plot is a jumbled mess, the changes made to the original story are unnecessary, the abysmal CGI (ESPECIALLY the Seven Dwarves that reach uncanny valley territory!) and a complete miscast of the villain played by Gal Gadot: she doesn't strike me at all as the bad guy, her performance & singing voice are so over-the-top and goofy that it's hard being invested in her, especially compared to the original which was one of the best villains in movie history (then again, the screenplay did not help her at all)

Just a bland remake with a few saving graces, period.",5/10
"To start off, Rachel Zegler is VERY talented. She has the abilities to sing classically like Snow White, but that was not chosen for the plot.

This was a product of poor directing and story writing. Disney needs to realize that there has to be an actual plot if they're going to change a classic, and if there wasn't one to begin with, then don't remake the movie. The songs were cringe. (Zegler can SING! But they should've used those talents elsewhere.) The plot was so forced.

Disney, PLEASE leave behind the ""girlboss"" archetype. The Barbie Movie said it best: what's wrong with a normal Barbie? Not everyone is a superhero princess world changer. There's nothing wrong with that, but make something new. I love the Live Action Remakes, but don't change them.",1/10
"Not worth it. Don't think disney can top this for a good while. The ride to the theatre and back home was more entertaining than the movie. It was so bad even the magic mirror would refuse to watch it. CGI characters looked like a rejected video game NPC's. Gal Gadot, don't even get me started on that, she seem very confused af for some reason. If someone compiled all Brain rot youtube videos and made a movie, that will be more entertaining and idk would make sense than this, why ever this was. If you value your time, watch paint dry, it's prolly cheaper and far more entertaining. DO NOT REDEEM!!!!!",1/10
"I don't even get what their intentions are when they made this live action movie.

It literally lost the main identity from the original one and doesn't even have it's own base, from the cast choice to the CGI.. everything is garbage.

Disney needs to start listening to the Audience feedback!! Everything is about the Audience so if the Audience isn't happy then it's just waste money and potential, so my message for Disney is please stop ruining Old tales and please work to make your Audience happy because after all this whole work is for people to like it.

If you want to make live action movies, at least do it properly.",1/10
"I can't even begin to fathom the disasters behind the scenes that led to this unnecessary adaptation. Disney has taken a beloved classic and stripped it of its charm, leaving behind a lifeless attempt to modernize something that never needed fixing. The heart and soul of the original are nowhere to be found, replaced with hollow storytelling and misguided choices. Disney needs to stop recycling their animated masterpieces into soulless cash grabs. Not every classic needs a remake, and especially not like this! Hopefully the cancel any upcoming ones to save some face and $. Insane to think we don't have good Star Wars or pirates of the Caribbean shows but we're getting assaulted in the eyes.",1/10
"This movie delivers a truly magical viewing experience, capturing the classic Disney charm while offering a modern twist. Rachel Zegler's voice is angelic, and the CGI dwarves are incredibly detailed, making them feel like real characters. I especially appreciated how the film developed a strong friendship between Snow White and Jonathan, which adds depth to her character and moves away from the older version of the story. This film is perfect for families and fans of the original Snow White, offering a fresh and empowering take on a timeless tale.

And that's why I think people should watch it.",8/10
"L script, L acting, L movie. This movie deserved better than what they did. They could've cast a better actor to play Snow White, but instead, they chose someone who completely missed the mark. The writing was lazy, the acting was uninspired, and the overall execution felt like a missed opportunity. The source material deserved respect, but what we got was a bland, forgettable attempt that lacked the magic and charm of the original.

The biggest issue is that nothing about this adaptation feels authentic. The character of Snow White, who is supposed to be endearing and full of warmth, comes across as flat and unlikable. There's no depth to her performance, no emotion that makes you root for her journey. The supporting cast isn't much better, with performances that feel either overacted or completely phoned in.

On top of that, the visuals are nothing special. The CGI looks rushed, the cinematography is dull, and the costume design feels uninspired. It's as if the filmmakers had no real vision and just slapped something together to capitalize on nostalgia. Overall, a disappointing take on a beloved classic.",1/10
"I cringed so hard while watching this that my face might be permanently stuck in a wince. This adaptation doesn't just miss the mark-it's so far off that the target isn't even in sight. If they had given this a completely different name and removed any reference to Snow White, I wouldn't have even realized what it was supposed to be.

The acting? Terrible. The story? An insult to the original. The casting? A complete joke. The visuals? Embarrassing.

I wouldn't even give this a one-star rating, because honestly, it doesn't deserve a rating at all. It's a zero. A waste of time, a disgrace to the fairytale, and an example of how NOT to do a remake. If you value your childhood memories, do yourself a favor-skip this one entirely.",1/10
"This movie is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The CGI is so bad that it looks completely unrealistic, making every scene feel cheap and lifeless. The visuals alone are enough to ruin any immersion, but the overall execution is just as terrible. The writing is awful, the acting feels forced, and the entire production lacks any heart or effort. It's nothing but a soulless cash grab that completely disrespects the original story. The characters are dull, the pacing is off, and there's no real charm or magic. Even the dialogue feels unnatural, making it painful to sit through. A total waste of time-avoid at all costs.",1/10
"Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White feels uninspired and miscast. Instead of embodying the classic character's charm and warmth, her portrayal comes across as flat and disconnected. Her delivery lacks the innocence and sincerity that made the original Snow White so beloved, and at times, she seems more disinterested than enchanting. The film's attempt to modernize the character strips away her defining traits, making her feel generic rather than iconic. Combined with lackluster dialogue and weak chemistry with the supporting cast, Zegler's Snow White fails to capture the magic that made the original a classic.",1/10
"This film is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The costumes look cheap and uninspired, making it feel more like a low-budget school play than a professional production. The acting is equally dreadful-wooden performances, zero chemistry, and completely miscast roles. It's almost painful to watch. The plot lacks creativity, failing to capture any of the magic of the original. The heart, charm, and wonder that made the classic so beloved are nowhere to be found. Instead of honoring the masterpiece that paved the way for Disney's success, this movie feels like a disgraceful mockery. The dialogue is bland, the pacing is off, and the overall execution is laughably bad. If you truly love the original, do yourself a favor and skip this mess. It's not worth your time or money.",1/10
"The new Snow White movie is a complete disaster-an insult to the original and a painful watch from start to finish. The writing is lifeless, the acting feels forced, and the CGI is laughably bad.

It's a soulless cash grab that should have never been made. 1/10-stay far away from this trainwreck.",1/10
"Dreadful. Simply dreadful. Rachel Zegler's performance stood alone, a solitary spark in an otherwise abysmal film. Gal Gadot's portrayal was, to put it mildly, bewildering. The dialogue felt forced, the plot convoluted, and the visual effects were surprisingly cheap. The entire production screamed of rushed execution and a complete lack of creative vision. I struggled to understand the hype surrounding this project. Every scene felt like a chore to endure. The attempt to modernize a classic tale resulted in a garish, uninspired mess. The supporting cast was forgettable, the musical score generic, and the overall pacing was agonizingly slow. I left the cinema feeling cheated and utterly disappointed. To grant Gadot a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame after such a performance seems like a cruel joke. Avoid this film at all costs; your time would be better spent staring at a blank wall.",1/10
"This movie was TERRIBLE. Of all the live-action (kind of) remakes, Disney should have been the most careful with this one. Snow White established Disney as we know it today, and saved the company.

As thanks, they've twisted the story, the songs, and the meaning of the story so much that it's almost unrecognizable.

Shame on Disney for making this wretched movie. The only bright spot at all was the Heigh Ho song, which was very much close to the original and made me feel like I was in Disneyland again as a kid. But that only lasted for 2.5 minutes, and if I want to hear that song again I can hear it online for free.

AVOID THIS MOVIE!",1/10
"Snow White (2025) is a deeply emotional and breathtaking reimagining of the classic fairy tale that will leave you wiping away tears. This movie is not just a fairy tale; it's a rich, emotional journey about growth, loss, and self-discovery. Honestly, I wasn't prepared for how hard it would hit me, and by the end, I needed a box of tissues.

Positives:

Rachel Zegler shines as Snow White. She brings a modern, empowering take on the character, making her more than just a damsel in distress. Snow White is strong, relatable, and fully in control of her own destiny. Zegler captures both the innocence and the power of Snow White's journey, making her transformation feel real and heartfelt.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of Maleficent is truly stunning. While Maleficent is traditionally the villain, this version adds layers of depth to her character. Gadot's Maleficent is not just evil for the sake of it-she's a woman broken by betrayal and pain. There are moments when you can't help but sympathize with her, even though her actions are cruel. The final confrontation with Maleficent is emotional and earned, and while it's clear she deserves to be defeated, you still feel the weight of her loss. Gadot's performance brings a unique complexity to the character, making her defeat both satisfying and bittersweet.

One of the most charming parts of the film is the cuteness overdose with the animals. From Snow White's connection with the birds and squirrels to the delightful creatures that help her along the way, these adorable moments add so much warmth to the film. They also help showcase Snow White's kindness and purity. If you love animals in fairy tales, you'll absolutely fall in love with these moments, though at times the cuteness factor might make your heart explode!

Negatives:

The pacing slows down a little in the middle of the film, especially in the quieter moments. While these moments do add emotional depth, they can feel a bit drawn out for some viewers. However, this is a minor issue in an otherwise well-paced film that does a great job of building emotional tension.

Conclusion:

Snow White (2025) is a modern fairy tale that feels fresh, emotional, and deeply relatable. The performances, especially by Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, are top-notch. Gadot's Maleficent is a standout complicated, tragic, and unforgettable. The cuteness of the animal companions adds a light, heartwarming touch, though sometimes it may feel like a little too much. However, it's all part of the charm.

The film's ending, while sad, is perfect for the story it tells: a bittersweet reminder that sometimes, to follow our dreams, we have to let go of things we love. Snow White's journey isn't just about defeating Maleficent-it's about finding her own strength and embracing who she truly is. It's a stunning, emotional experience that leaves you with a sense of fulfillment, but also a little bit of sorrow.",10/10
"Never thought I would ever watch a Disney movie and rooting for the baddies. Unlikeable and unrecognisable characters heavily deviated from the original story. Heavy and unnecessary use of CGI. Zero star is the correct rating but here I am needing to give a star minimum. Disney needs to rethink their future approach to classic remake. While we do not expect 100% identical script from the classic, there has to be a high level of familiarity to the original. Otherwise it's becoming a re-imaginations rather than a remake. This is the case for this Snow White movie. It's a horrible version of re-imagination rather than a faithful remake of the classic.",1/10
"This *Snow White* remake is a dull, uninspired mess that strips away the magic of the original. The writing is stiff, the humor falls flat, and the characters lack charm. Snow White is unlikable, the Evil Queen is forgettable, and the dwarfs are sidelined. The CGI looks fake, the pacing drags, and the songs are bland. Worse, the film seems ashamed of its roots, making unnecessary changes that alienate fans while failing to offer anything compelling. It's a soulless cash grab that lacks heart, charm, and entertainment. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one. The acting is just soo terrible how was it even allowed to go to cinemas.",1/10
"This version has been heavily modified from the original. If you want to see the classic remake. This is not for you.

First they changed the reason of her name is Snow White is no longer due to her physical appearance. The end, the dancing theme is also creepy. It does not connect with the story line.

If you are open minded and a fan of Rachel or Gal, then go for it.

Unfortunately, it's not for me, and can't get a refund on the movie tickets and my time back.

It's perplexing to me why Disney didn't just produce a completely different movie. I feel this one really hurts fan especially the ones grew up with the original Snow White.",1/10

Me and my friend came out thinking at least we still can save time after like 40 mins. Acting is not great. I do not like the costumes. And story.

"Disney's latest Snow White is a complete disappointment. It abandons the charm, magic, and timeless storytelling of the original in favor of a bland, uninspired reimagining that lacks heart. The casting and script changes feel forced, stripping away the fairy-tale essence that made the story beloved for generations. The CGI is unimpressive, and the dwarfs-if you can even call them that-are barely relevant. Worse yet, the film seems more focused on making a statement than telling a compelling story. Instead of celebrating the classic, Disney delivers a joyless, forgettable mess that fails to capture the magic of Snow White.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White (2025) was one of the most controversial live-action adaptations before it even hit theaters. Unfortunately, after watching it, I can confidently say that it was a disappointment. While I had some initial concerns based on the changes announced during production, I still hoped for a fresh yet faithful take on the beloved fairy tale. However, the final product felt disconnected from the original story in almost every way. Beyond casting, the film's approach to the story itself was frustrating. Instead of staying true to the classic fairy tale, the writers made drastic changes that stripped the story of its original charm. One of the most baffling decisions was removing the prince's role entirely.",1/10
"The soul of Snow white should be encouraging kindness and love. That is the reason why the animals, creatures and prince all followed her and help her to fight with the evil queen. The truth is every creature on earth does have the natural sense to feel kindness and love in others. Snow white should retain such kindness and love to positively influencing people, just like the original Snow white. The value of society did change throughout the years since the original Snow White, however, there are something such as love and kindness which would not be changed in this world and Disney should use Snow White to teach our children what cannot be changed deeply in our heart.

Above all, there is nothing wrong to use kindness and love to fight the evils.",1/10
"Snowwhite's latest cinematic iteration is a confounding exercise in modern mediocrity that defies reverence. In a misguided attempt to revive a cherished classic, this remaster instead exudes an unnerving hollowness, leaving audiences adrift in a dismal fever dream. The film's visuals, though technologically polished, betray an absence of genuine soul, rendering its narrative inert and unengaging. Its earnest yet misdirected effort transforms what was once enchanting into a forgettable spectacle. Regrettably, this production stands as an indelible mark of artistic miscalculation-a veritable anomaly that should be expunged from our digital memories and consigned to the annals of cinematic regret.",1/10
"Boring snooze fest. Struggled to stay awake throughout most of it. Cinema was already only a quarter full and I could see everyone struggling to stay awake to watch it.

Literally a waste of the ticket price. Changes so much of the classic Snow White story. Almost unrecognizable as the original Snow White, was butchered badly. Poor acting from the main female lead, unemotionless and wooden. Could probably do better by putting wooden mannequins instead of the actors and actressses.

I hope they lose so much money from this show that the execs who approved this show get fired. Disney keeps hitting new lows recently.",1/10
"The new Snow White movie is visually stunning with beautiful scenery and impressive special effects. The supporting cast does a commendable job, adding depth and charisma to their roles. However, Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is a major disappointment. Her acting feels flat and emotionless, failing to capture the innocence and charm of the beloved character. The chemistry between her and other characters is unconvincing, which makes it hard for the audience to connect with the story. Fans of the classic tale will likely be frustrated, as Zegler's portrayal lacks the magic and grace that Snow White deserves. Overall, while the movie excels in many technical aspects, Rachel Zegler's poor acting skills significantly detract from the film's potential, leaving viewers yearning for a more compelling and heartfelt performance.",1/10
"The movie moving completely away from the original story is not the only negative this movie has.

Romance arc was horrible. Felt soo forced. Meets the guy and 5 seconds later they are in love. Very very believable.

Snow white at some point is a girly girl dancing around, and at another point is a strong independent women ordering people around. Like what???

Below mediocre acting by her. The last dance felt like torture.

Gal gadot was the only performance which i thought looked good and deserved praise. That should say something considering she is not the lead.

I have no more words for this.",1/10
"The movie completely ruined the original for me. This isn't Snow White-it should have been titled something else entirely, to be honest. The essence of the classic story is missing, and the changes they made feel unnecessary and forced. Rachel Zegler is not at all convincing as Snow White; she lacks the charm, innocence, and grace that made the original character so beloved. Her performance feels out of place, and she doesn't capture the magic that the role demands. The only saving grace of the film is Gal Gadot, whose screen presence is undeniably captivating. She brings a certain elegance and charisma that stands out amid the otherwise messy storytelling. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is all over the place, with an incoherent plot, uneven pacing, and a distorted vision that strays too far from the beloved fairy tale. The writing feels weak, the direction lacks focus, and overall, it fails to deliver the enchantment and wonder that made the original a timeless classic.",1/10
"Unfortunately, the new adaptation of ""Snow White"" fails to capture the magical essence of the classic that we all know and love. Despite having a talented cast, the movie feels flat and predictable, as if it were following a tired formula.

The story, which should be a journey full of emotions and unexpected twists, becomes a series of clichés and forced dialogues that lack depth. The characterization of Snow White is disappointing; she seems more like an archetype than a real protagonist with whom we can empathize. The dwarfs, given a new interpretation, end up being more caricatures than endearing characters, thus losing their original charm.

Moreover, the direction and cinematography do not bring anything fresh to the table. The scenes feel more like they're pulled from a catalog than from a vibrant fantasy world. The soundtrack, instead of complementing the visuals, feels like background noise that fails to resonate with the audience.",1/10
".. CGI is awful. Storyline is awful.

Acting for both characters is awful. I wonder why Disney gamble with this movie.

This is a live action so why they changed the story? That's what confused me. Mirror Mirror is way better. That's what I expecting but they gave us this garbage.

They decided to make the dwarves CGI than hiring a real people.

I hope the next live action will not be like this. Awful reboot of a classic disney animation. This is the worst live action of all Disney movies.

When this movie streams in Disney plus, I will make this my bedtime movie to sleep with. Not gonna lie. Worst for real.",1/10
"This movie isn't just bad-it's embarrassingly bad. It takes a beloved classic and strips away everything that made it magical, replacing it with lifeless characters, cringeworthy dialogue.

Instead of capturing the beauty of the original story that is almost loved by everyone, it talks down to its audience, assuming we have the emotional depth of a rock. The visuals? Bland. CGI? Nothing to explan for it, a 19s animation, maybe. The storytelling? Nonexistent. The depth of the storyline? Completely gone. Characters? I wont dare mention about it you know that. This isn't a reimagining-it's a dumpster fire.",1/10
"The scenes looked magical and the soundtrack was far better than the recent disney movies, in my opinion. It had a great message about leading with fairness, being kind, and being brave to stand up to evil. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will be listening to the music! Rachel zegler has an amazing voice and gal gadot performed an amazing evil queen. This movie exceeded my expectations by far and my whole family enjoyed seeing it. The forest, animals and dwarves all looked beautiful and magical. Truly a beautiful movie. The costumes turned out better than everyone made it out to be. Can't wait to watch it again!",10/10
Giving it a star is way too much. I do not like either of the main characters they are a joke. Disney has fell off and this movie proves it perfectly. The evil queen is prettier and Farah there's no way how is that possible? It makes no sense. What is the world coming to? I used to look forward to watching movies like these but no more I would rather watch Barney then watch this nonsense sadly this is what cinematography has come to and is a taste of what to come in the future. There are a few movies with good stories and even if you are really good remix I did however enjoy Mufasa which is a good remake.,1/10
"Worst Disney remake in the catalog! This movie has been hijacked and doesn't do justice to the original cartoon. The acting is horrible, the use of CGI is appalling is too bad that Disney has allowed this to happen. My hope is the same does not continue to happen in future releases. The entire story has been changed. Wouldn't it be better have they just started from scratch But unfortunately, this movie was nothing but a cash grab from Disney.

Too many mistakes are made to recommend this to anyone. It's unfortunate for all of the workers who works so diligently to put this film out that a single person could ruin it for everyone.",1/10
"It's really bad, especially the CGI - is it hard to give jobs to little people? Where people in charge scared or something?

I made my account just so I'm able to give that rating because that move made me really sad - money thrown away. The regret I'm feeling after watching it is so big that I'm unable to express it. Time wasted.

Also, that's really not an ideal actress for the Snow White, she should practice more her face expressions etc. Exactly like someone said - I was rooting for the apple in this scenario + what happened with ""lips red like roses"" or something? Disney should stop with live action movies.",1/10
"A horrible movie, made even worse by the horrible acting of Gal Gadot.

I gave this movie a one star rating, symbolising the only good thing in this movie i.e Rachel Zegler and if it wasn't for her I would have not even bothered giving that one either.

Why is Gal gadget being casted in such big projects when everyone know she can not act at all. Hollywood needs to know the face card doesn't always play. But they never learn.

The script was terrible, it was a desperate attempt to cash in on story that people have nostalgic associations with.

I believe this would go down in the history as one of the worst movies of all time.",1/10
"Disney had the perfect blueprint for a live-action Snow White-the beloved 1937 animated masterpiece. Yet, instead of honoring the magic that defined generations, they chose to strip away its charm and identity.

From the lackluster costumes to the uninspired sets, everything about this remake screams low budget and lack of passion. The visual storytelling, once rich and enchanting, now feels flat and unremarkable. It's baffling how Disney, with all its resources, could produce something so lifeless.

And this is still without mentioning the casting choices, which feel completely detached from the fairy tale's essence. Watching this movie was not just disappointing-it was heartbreaking. Disney used to create magic; now, it seems more interested in dismantling it.",1/10
"Disney's latest live-action remake of ""Snow White"" is a lackluster attempt to modernize a beloved classic, resulting in a film that feels both uninspired and unnecessary. Despite Rachel Zegler's commendable performance as the titular character, the movie fails to capture the magic of the original, leaving audiences with a hollow and forgettable experience.

The film's narrative is cluttered and muddled, attempting to update the story with progressive themes but ultimately losing the charm that made the 1937 animated version a timeless masterpiece. The pacing is off, leading to a disjointed viewing experience that neither honors the original nor offers a compelling new take.",1/10
"I regret I wasted money on this movie. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I hope it will be at least fine to watch 1 time. Sadly not. I hope the company will think about new ideas, new characters, new worlds and stop ruining its legacy. Stop thinking like ""we must include this and this in the movie"", and start thinking to how to bring joy to the people. I have nothing against the actors, I blame the director, script writer and producer. Actors worked to gain their money, it is a job. Wrong ideas, wrong casting, wrong people worked on movie. And I am glad this movie failed, I hope Disney will open their eyes.",1/10
"Snow White (2025) is, without question, a visual spectacle and a thoughtful reimagining of Disney's first animated masterpiece. The film boasts stunning production design, a carefully crafted atmosphere, and a supporting cast that brings fresh life to this classic tale. Unfortunately, what could have been a near-perfect remake is held back by its most crucial element - Snow White herself.

Let's start with what the movie gets right, because there is a lot to admire. The world of Snow White (2025) is nothing short of breathtaking. The enchanted forest, the Queen's dark castle, and the whimsical cottage of the dwarfs are all realized with an incredible attention to detail. The art direction balances fairy tale charm with a slightly darker, mature aesthetic that fits well with modern audiences without losing the magic of the original. Each location feels like it belongs in a storybook brought to life.

The supporting cast is equally impressive. The Evil Queen, played with chilling perfection, steals every scene she's in. Her presence is magnetic, and her character feels both menacing and tragic - exactly the kind of complexity a modern fairytale villain needs. The dwarfs, while slightly modernized, still retain the humor and heart that made them so beloved in the original. They share excellent chemistry, delivering both genuine laughs and emotional moments.

The soundtrack is another highlight. The film features a combination of refreshed classics and new songs, and most of them work surprisingly well. The orchestral arrangements are grand and cinematic, making both quiet character moments and sweeping adventure scenes feel impactful. The musical numbers performed by the dwarfs and the Queen stand out as some of the film's best.

So what went wrong? Sadly, the answer lies with Snow White herself. The lead actress delivers a performance so flat and disconnected that it drags down almost every scene she appears in. Snow White is supposed to be the emotional heart of the story - a symbol of kindness, hope, and inner strength. Yet here, she comes across as stiff, unconvincing, and at times, awkwardly uninterested in the world around her.

Whether it's due to poor direction, miscasting, or a lack of understanding of the character, the performance simply doesn't land. Key scenes that should have been touching - such as Snow White's interactions with the dwarfs, her wonder at discovering the forest, or her confrontation with the Queen - all feel emotionally hollow. Her line delivery often lacks emotion, and her facial expressions rarely reflect the gravity or magic of the situations unfolding around her.

It's a shame because the film itself gives her every opportunity to shine. The script is respectful to the character, the cinematography frames her beautifully, and the supporting actors do their best to lift her up, but she simply fails to carry the role. A stronger performance could have elevated the entire movie to something truly special.

That being said, Snow White (2025) is far from a failure. It still delivers a memorable cinematic experience thanks to its gorgeous visuals, impressive supporting performances, and a clear love for the source material. The film successfully balances nostalgia with a few modern updates, making it accessible to both longtime fans and new audiences.

Ultimately, Snow White (2025) is a good movie trapped beneath a weak leading performance. While it may not reach its full potential, it is still worth watching for its artistry, world-building, and the fantastic work done by everyone - except Snow White herself.",1/10
"I watched it with the preconceived notion it would not be that good.and was pleasantly surprised that it exceeded my expectations. The singing parts where great, had a nice theatrical vibe, that I enjoyed. Thought it was a great movie to watch at the movies to give the songs justice.

Both lead actresses were great and gave a good performance. It was quite differant from the original but I didn't mind the changes, it is essentially a fairy tale that has had changes made to it before. Still love the original and will add this to my disney list of movies I love. I would recommend this movie to watch.",10/10
"Snow White, the original animated film, was incredibly popular and was responsible for a much needed morale boost during a dark time in the US and the globe.

The remake is not a credit to the original, in many ways it makes a mockery of the original, taking the beloved character and shifting her entirely into someone else.

This movie makes no sense. It is a complete disaster. Disney did not work on the script, horrible actor selection and extremely poor CGI. This movie has everything wrong with modern cinema. The lead actress has no charisma and is not talented to work on classics like Snow White.",1/10
"Gal Gadot's performance was painfully wooden, with lifeless delivery and zero acting skills. She lacked any real screen presence, making every scene she was in feel dull and boring. It's almost impressive how someone can suck the life out of a role this badly. Easily one of the worst performances of the year. Thankfully, Rachel was there to save this film from being a total disaster. Her charisma and talent added just enough to make it somewhat watchable.

Honestly disney messed up taking on gal as a actress. Every movie she made was awful. This is the reason for 1 star.

Congrats disney for ruining a good fairy tale.",1/10
"A total disaster. The story is lifeless, the acting is wooden, and the magic is completely missing. This remake butchers a classic and turns it into a boring, soulless mess. The visuals are uninspired, the dialogue feels forced, and the charm of the original is completely lost. It tries to be modern but ends up feeling hollow and preachy. Disney should have left this one alone instead of turning a beloved fairy tale into an unwatchable slog. The characters lack depth, the humor falls flat, and the emotional moments feel forced. A dull, forgettable cash grab that fails on every level. Avoid at all costs.",1/10
Stop ruining our childhood Disney! I wanna see the snow white I grow up with it's fine for woman to want true love and to be kind and soft that doesn't take her stongth away Don't mess with the og characters ! Make New one !

Especially the old drawing style gave a lovely vibe and aesthetic.,1/10
"Watch it to know, avoid it for peace of mind.

Disney's Snow White remake utterly misses the magic. Rachel Zegler's performance feels forced and charmless, reducing the beloved princess to a modern caricature that lacks depth or authenticity. The CGI-dominated visuals overshadow any potential emotional connection, turning classic scenes into cold, lifeless displays. Even the iconic songs fall flat, stripped of their nostalgic joy. Instead of reviving a timeless tale, this adaptation offers only a hollow, uninspired retread, disrespecting the heart and spirit of the original. A disappointing misfire, leaving fans longing for the genuine enchantment Disney once mastered.",1/10
"One of the worst movie I've ever seen, money wasted, time wasted and it's better to watch youtube than this ""masterpiece"".

If you are planning to watch this movie you should just save your time to stay home, watch another movie, watch youtube, play games, go outside touch some grass and go buy a drink. Doing anything is better than to watch this ""masterpiece"" And I REPEAT DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.

Doing anything else is way way better than to go watch is movie, one of the WORST movie of all time, I wish i could turn back time and get my time back from wasting my valuable time from watch this and I am writing this to warn you.",1/10
This movie was a hot mess right fron the beginning! From the actresses and actors to the ugly cgi'd dwarves and odd looking animals! I should have saved the thirty bucks that I spent to see this Disney Dud and watched paint dry instead. The kids were bored and my husband decided to go wait in the truck for us. I couldnt wait for the ending credits. I will never fall for another Disney trailer again no matter who plays in it or what its about. Our family will just stick to the old Disney movies and books for the kids. At least I know what to expect fron them and the kids wont be crying about how boring and stupid this movie is!,1/10
"Unfortunately, Disney has once again delivered a live-action remake that, despite its high production value and impressive visuals, ultimately fails to capture the emotional depth, narrative charm, and timeless wonder that made the original animated version so beloved; instead, it feels like a soulless, commercially driven attempt to cash in on nostalgia, with lackluster performances, uninspired direction, and a noticeable absence of the heartfelt storytelling that once defined Disney's magic.""!!! Disney should be a shame destroying their own brand. Disney should do a better job and stop destroying your brand.",1/10
"People who have posted a negative review of this movie either haven't seen it yet or are just bonafide Disney haters. You have to admit that the original movie lacked any character development or an actual love story, which this version provided expertly. The music is great, and me and my family will be singing the songs on repeat for a long time to come. We loved the mix of the old in with the new. Snow White has always been a favorite for my three year old, so we went to see it opening day. Since then she's been asking to see the ""new"" Snow White over and over. We definitely can't wait for it to be out on streaming!",10/10
"This is not the Snow White we grew up with.

Rachel is an okay singer but she does not represent Snow White at all. The story changed too much from the original. They should just make new movies instead of butchering classics.

Gal Gadot is not a good actress and she did not deserve the role of the Evil Queen. Completely out of character.

If it was not passed as a live action remake and was instead advertised as a new story, this might have been okay but this did not live up to Disney's reputation.

Overall disappointed about this. Even the theaters were empty so do not waste your time. Romance movies should not be seen as a bad thing. Snow White is a cute and feminine princess who should be kept that way.",1/10
"The story is set in a forest, not a bustling city like New York during peak hours-so creating an immersive fairytale world shouldn't have been a monumental task. Yet, despite this, the film fails to deliver even the simple charm of a visually appealing fairy tale. If Pixar had made this movie, the CGI would have been far superior, the protagonist more likable, and the humor more effective.

We all know this classic story, and we all know where it's headed. What we wanted was to lose ourselves in an old German fairy tale, but that proved impossible due to poor CGI, cheap costumes, lackluster acting, and an overall lack of magic. I have to say, René doesn't seem suited for Hollywood-unlike Gal Gadot, who at least brings some star power. If you're considering watching this in theaters, you may want to think twice; no cinema screen can elevate a mediocre production.",1/10

"The rating is kind.

I guess they tried to keep the Snow White costumes for more exact nostalgia but ends up looking dated and cringeworthy.

Could have kept the old version vibe but made the appearance more modern and/or realistic.

I CGI is nasty - go full live or not in as much a possible.

The Snow White & the Huntsman gsve an excellent example of a high quality remake ... this just feels sickly sweet - and I didn't feel anything fir any of the characters.

The CGI dwarves were distracting and I could not see Ziegler and see Snow White - she just does not fit the look of the character- to an extent that's it's distracting...",5/10
"Amid several controversies and a troubled production, the latest Snow White live-action adaptation is finally out, and the verdict is this film is quite...average. Controversies about her casting aside, Rachel Zegler delivers a fine performance and basically carries the movie on her shoulders (and unlike another thespian I'll mention shortly, this girl can actually act). The story was changed in a few key parts, but still falls short of the magic of the 1937 original. Among the most jarring decisions, creating the dwarves using CGI so they resemble their animated counterparts was the worst of all, rendering an uncanny valley appearance which could be easily resolved by hiring seven actual little people for the job. And the other awful aspect was the casting of Gal Gadot. I always considered her to be an average actress at best, but this must be a career worst. Barring some real stinker performance coming along in the next months, they must already be engraving her Razzie as I type these words. Certainly there were more competent actresses that could infuse some life in this role, but Gadot's wooden cartoonish performance is atrocious, and even if Disney hired her on account of her fame alone, that plan certainly backfired as her acting is being heavily criticized and the box office projections don't seem promising. In the end, the movie is passable basically on Zegler's authentic performance and a bit of nostalgia for the original animated film. It's far from the disaster some were foreseeing, but is definitely a one-time watch which will come and go without leaving much of a mark.",5/10
"Mirror Mirror on the wall, which is the most disastrous movie of 2025 among them all Mirror : Snow White by Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot.

Astoundingly bad and worst vfx/cgi with poor poor poor acting and performance. I want refund but that's not possible.

This movie makes no sense. It is a complete disaster. Disney did not work on the script, horrible actor selection and extremely poor CGI. This movie has everything wrong with modern cinema This remake is an insult to the classic. It's devoid of magic, charm, and any semblance of storytelling. How Disney managed to mess this up is beyond me Rachel Zegler's performance is wooden and lacks any of the warmth or innocence that made Snow White lovable. It's like watching a high school play, but with a $250 million budget.",2/10
"Yep, this is as bad as people are saying it is. Which is a shame because i was kind of looking forward to seeing a beloved classic. But unfortunately there was no plot to a movie that literally has a plot written for it already, the characters were devoid of character throughout the film, the lines were about as dry as the visuals, honestly the score is half was decent, but overall this is a hard pass. Even the kids and spouse who mind you were looking forward to seeing this were let down, one of the kids even feel asleep half way through, first time for everything I guess. I wouldn't recommend this movie for the family.",1/10

Gal Gadot was brilliant and she showed a side I wasn;'t aware - she can really sing!

So next time you're critiquing, ask you're kids what they thought and look at the smiles on their faces! The producers achieved their goal, the aminators nailed it and the cast hit the ball out of the park! Congratulations to all the team for a worthy remake!",10/10

"The script is unreasonable and has a lot of plot holes.

The actors are not suitable for the characters.

Unconsistancy characteristics, for both Snow White and Evil Queen.

Not sure if they want to adapt from the original or keep the original because everything looks in between.

Unlike Cinderella, they kept the original and still made it good by giving more back story so it made all characters rounded. Or Maleficent, that they chose to adapt and make the good story of the other side of the villain.

Snow White is nothing like these two.

The good thing in this movie is the songs and CGI, which made me continue watching to the end.",1/10
"Alright, so I watched the 2025 Snow White movie, and oh my gosh, it was a total disaster-like, one-star level bad. I'm not even exaggerating, this thing was a snooze fest from start to finish. I thought it'd be cool since it's Disney and they usually make dope stuff, but nah, this was a straight-up letdown. I'm gonna break it down for you because I've got a lot to say about how much this sucked.

First off, the story? Boring AF. Like, I get it's a remake of the old fairy tale, but did it have to feel so dead? It's Snow White, the girl with the seven dwarfs and the evil queen, but this time it's all live-action and modern or whatever. Except it's not exciting at all. It drags on forever, and I kept checking my phone because I couldn't care less about what was happening. They tried to make it all ""girl power"" and stuff, which is fine, I guess, but it just felt forced and lame. The plot was so predictable I could've told you the ending five minutes in. Evil Queen hates Snow White, poisons her with an apple, blah blah blah-nothing new, nothing fun. It's like they didn't even try to switch it up.

Then there's Rachel Zegler playing Snow White. Dude, she's supposed to be the star, right? But she's so meh. Like, she's pretty and can sing, I'll give her that, but her character has zero personality. She just walks around looking sad or smiling at the dwarfs, and I'm like, ""Girl, do something!"" I didn't feel bad for her or cheer for her or anything. She's just... there. I don't know if it's her fault or the script's, but either way, Snow White was a total snooze. I wanted to root for her, but I couldn't because she was so basic.

Oh, and the dwarfs? Don't even get me started. They're these weird CGI things now, not real people, and it's so creepy. Like, they look like they're from a bad video game or something. I get they didn't want to use real little people or whatever, but these computer dudes were not it. They're supposed to be funny and cute, like in the cartoon, but nah, they just made me uncomfortable. Every time they showed up, I was like, ""Ew, what are those?"" It totally took me out of the movie. They had names and stuff-Doc, Grumpy, whatever-but I didn't care because they looked so fake and dumb.

The one kinda okay part was Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. She's pretty dope, and you can tell she's trying to make it work. She's all evil and smirky, and her outfits are fire, so that's something. But even she couldn't save this trainwreck. Like, she's the best thing in it, but the movie's so bad around her that it doesn't even matter. She's out here being all menacing and cool, but the story's too weak to back her up. It's like putting sprinkles on a burnt cupcake-it's still trash.

The whole look of the movie is alright, I guess. The costumes and sets are pretty, and it's all colorful and shiny. But that's not enough when everything else is garbage. It's like they spent all their money on making it look nice but forgot to make it fun to watch. And it's so freaking long, dude. I don't even know how long exactly, but it felt like three hours of nothing. I was squirming in my seat, ready to bounce, but I stuck it out just to say I saw the whole thing. Big mistake.

They tried to add new songs and stuff, but they're forgettable. I can't even hum one right now, that's how blah they were. The old songs like ""Whistle While You Work"" are in there, but they don't hit the same. It's like they wanted to be all modern and deep, but it just comes off cheesy and lame. I'd rather watch the cartoon again than sit through this mess.

Honestly, Disney dropped the ball hard. Why even remake Snow White if you're gonna make it this bad? It's not magical or fun or anything like the original. It's just a cash grab that didn't even grab my attention. I was so hyped for it too, because I love fairy tales and Disney movies, but this was a total waste of my time. One star, and that's me being nice because Gal Gadot tried. If you're thinking about watching it, just don't. Save yourself the pain, seriously. This movie's going straight to the trash bin in my brain. Ugh.",1/10
"First of all I love films and I've seen thousands of them and always try to be honest about the criticism bearing in mind the positive and negative aspects of them. There are several reasons why I would poorly rate this film but the main reason is how the story unfolds and the cast of the Evil Queen. I went to the cinema with my daughter who is a huge fan of Snow White and after not more than half of the story she was bored and wanted to leave. Also she recognized Gal s character from films she has seen and could not ""see her"" as evil....""Dad but she is not evil, she is the Wonder Woman..."" Also the narrative and the way it develops it nakes the pacing dull and uninteresting to watch. It is true that Rachel sings truly well and the visual effects are great but that is not what makes a film good.",2/10
"I'll speak abot Gal G first. She was lame, no range and her 'singing' scenes were a bit funny and cringe. You can TELL when her actual voice was used during the musical numbers, and they weren't very many. She has a terrible voice. Even the lip sync voice that was used was not all that great. Had to match Gal's I guess.

Ratchel, ACTUALLY had a beautiful voice. Her musical numbers were amazing, but were overshadowed by her flat range of acting. No emotion. Snow White is supposed to be a sweet kind, soft-spoken adolescent. There was non of that in this movie. Didnt care for the story and the characters were dull. About the only thing great were Ratchels numbers.",2/10
"This movie is an absolute trainwreck that manages to insult a beloved classic at every turn. The film's attempt to modernize a well-known fairytale falls flat in every conceivable way. The script is clumsily written, full of outdated clichés and forced twists that feel more like gimmicks than genuine innovation. Performances are wooden, and the direction seems almost apathetic-it's as if the filmmakers simply didn't care enough to make a coherent movie.

Pros: Absolutely nothing

Cons: A muddled, incoherent narrative that barely holds together.

Lackluster performances that sap any potential emotional impact.

Visual effects that look like they were thrown together on a shoestring budget.

Overall, a profound misfire that squanders the legacy of a classic story.

A monumental failure that not only wastes its own potential but also disrespects the source material. Save your time and money-this film is one hell of an abomination, wish Id never seen it.",2/10
"I just got out of the new Snow White movie, and I have to vent. This was one of the most disappointing remakes I've seen in a long time. I went in with low expectations, but somehow, it still managed to let me down. I don't even know where to start, but let's just go piece by piece.

First off, Snow White herself. I don't know what they were thinking with this casting, but she just didn't fit the role at all. Snow White is supposed to be this sweet, innocent, almost ethereal character, and instead, we got someone who felt way too modern and out of place. She didn't have that fairytale charm, and honestly, she didn't even seem to want to be there. Like, if you're going to play THE Snow White, at least try to capture the magic of the character. Instead, she was just kind of... there. No warmth, no wonder, just flat delivery and attitude that felt more like a reluctant Disney Channel character than a timeless princess.

And don't even get me started on the story changes. They basically gutted everything that made Snow White special in the first place. The entire point of her character was that she was kind, trusting, and innocent in a world that was cruel, and that goodness is what ultimately saved her. But nope, that was apparently too outdated, so instead, they made her some kind of independent warrior figure who doesn't need saving. Look, I get updating old stories, but when you strip away the heart of the original, why even call it Snow White? It felt like they wanted to use the name but had zero interest in actually telling the story that people love.

Then there's the dwarfs-or, well, the lack of dwarfs. This part made me so mad. Instead of the classic seven dwarfs, we got this weird group of random people that didn't have any of the charm or personality that made the originals so memorable. Grumpy, Dopey, Doc, Bashful-gone. Instead, we get these generic side characters that have zero chemistry with Snow White. It's like the filmmakers didn't understand that the dwarfs weren't just background filler; they were the heart of the movie. Their friendship with Snow White is what made the original so emotional, and without that, the story just felt hollow.

And the Evil Queen? SUCH a letdown. She was supposed to be one of the most iconic villains of all time-vain, terrifying, and absolutely ruthless. But here, she was just... fine? Not menacing, not particularly interesting, just there. They tried to make her more ""complex,"" but in doing so, they sucked all the fun out of her character. Like, can we please just let villains be villains without over-explaining their motivations? The Evil Queen is iconic because she's obsessed with beauty and will do anything to maintain her status, and that's all she needs to be. I wanted a commanding, over-the-top presence, and instead, I got a watered-down, forgettable performance.

Also, the visuals. You'd think a Snow White remake would be visually stunning, right? A dreamlike fairytale world, beautiful costumes, something that really captures that magical, old-school Disney feel. Nope. Everything looked weirdly flat and uninspired. The CGI was painfully obvious, the costumes felt like cheap cosplay, and the whole thing lacked that whimsical, storybook aesthetic that should've been a given. It's Snow White-a movie that should look like a painting come to life-but instead, it had all the magic of a generic fantasy show on a streaming service.

And the music? Completely forgettable. The original had some of Disney's most iconic songs, and instead of embracing that, they either ditched them entirely or reworked them into bland, uninspired numbers. Like, Heigh-Ho? Someday My Prince Will Come? Nope. Gone. Replaced with... honestly, I can't even remember. That's how unmemorable it was.

Overall, the whole movie just felt like it was embarrassed to be Snow White. Like the filmmakers wanted to distance themselves from everything that made the original special while still slapping the name on it to cash in on nostalgia. It wasn't fun, it wasn't magical, and it definitely wasn't the Snow White we grew up with. Just a soulless, watered-down mess that completely missed the point.

Save yourself the disappointment and just rewatch the original.",1/10
"The storyline was nonexistent after several re-shoots this is what they decided to put in the world beyond disappointed. Disney really had a chance to make a classic instead they Keep going to their IP's and making them into live action money grabs The only thing that I can say was the singing, but the fact they only kept one of the original songs not to mention the ending absolutely no character development. The original movie that saved Disney has Conway all around and has damaged Disney's reputation to capture the magical world and storytelling. It's just sad. After numerous re-shoots, the storyline was severely compromised, resulting in a disappointing product. Disney had an opportunity to create a classic film, but instead, they continue to rely on their intellectual properties for profit-driven live-action adaptations. The only redeeming quality was the singing, although the decision to retain only one of the original songs and the lackluster ending further diminished the film's impact. The original movie, which revitalized Disney's reputation, featured Conway's exceptional performance and showcased the studio's ability to capture the magic of storytelling. Regrettably, this film has tarnished Disney's image and failed to deliver on its potential. After numerous re-shoots, the storyline was severely compromised, resulting in a product that left much to be desired. Disney had a unique opportunity to create a timeless classic, but they chose to rely on their existing intellectual properties, resulting in yet another profit-driven live-action adaptation. While the singing was commendable, the decision to retain only one of the original songs and the uninspiring ending further detracted from the film's overall impact. The original movie, which had revitalized Disney's reputation, featured Conway's outstanding performance and highlighted the studio's ability to capture the magic of storytelling. Unfortunately, this new iteration has tarnished Disney's image and failed to deliver on its immense potential.

"I feel like all the hate from this film is just ridiculous, from the casting, the music and the direction it was really amazing! I thought Rachel was so fierce as Snow White and really made a great character! Gal was always absolutely stunning as the Evil Queen, I kinda wish we saw more of her but in every scene with her was amazing! All the actors and crew really did amazing with this one, I'm not sure it's better than the cartoon but I really liked it. I'm definitely gonna watch it again on the big screen and honestly I feel like Disney is finally coming back and bringing the magic back! -Tracy Xen.",10/10
"Another mess of a Disney remake but at least they had Rachel Zegler, a shining gem of an actress and singer to save it (somewhat). Rachel is every bit of a what a princess should be and embodies Snow White with every breath of her being. Her songs were the highlight of the movie (maybe the only highlight), I especially loved her rendition of whistle why you work. Unfortunately her incredible performance could not save that abysmal acting and singing of her costar Gal Gadot, the offensive cgi dwarves, or the messy writing. It's absolutely insulting that Disney is trying to blame the failure of the movie on Rachel when she is the only shining light in this lazy cash grab of a film.",5/10
"It is a shame that Disney decided to distort one of its most iconic stories in such a way. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs from 1937 was a timeless classic, a milestone in animation history that remains beloved to this day. But instead of honoring this legacy, Disney's new Snow White adaptation has left both fans and critics scratching their heads in disbelief.

The biggest mistake of this remake is undoubtedly the casting of Rachel Zegler as Snow White. From the very beginning, she was a controversial choice, and her public comments about the original film only made matters worse. Zegler repeatedly stated that the 1937 movie was outdated and no longer relevant to modern society. Statements like these raise serious doubts about whether she has any real respect for the character she is supposed to portray. Her performance as Snow White is uninspired and artificial, lacking the grace, warmth, and charm that made the original character so beloved. She simply does not have the acting ability to carry a role that has been synonymous with Disney magic for nearly a century.

But as if that weren't bad enough, Disney made yet another baffling choice: casting Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. While Gadot may be known for her role as Wonder Woman, that does not automatically make her a capable actress. Her performance feels stiff and lacks any real menace-far from the dark, intimidating presence that the Queen had in the original film. While she may have the general appearance for the role, her acting remains flat and uninspired. She fails to bring even a fraction of the depth or cruelty needed to portray such an iconic villain convincingly.

Beyond the miscast leads, the movie is filled with one questionable decision after another. The seven dwarfs have been almost entirely removed or replaced with a random collection of characters that bear little resemblance to the original concept. This alone demonstrates how little respect the filmmakers have for the film's legacy. The beautiful music of the original has either been altered beyond recognition or discarded altogether because it was deemed ""outdated."" But it was precisely this music that made Snow White so unforgettable-a true fairytale experience brought to life through enchanting melodies.

Disney seems to be moving further away from the values that once made its classics so magical. Instead of creating films filled with heart and wonder, they continue to push soulless modern adaptations that no one asked for. Fans don't want watered-down reinterpretations that desperately try to appear progressive; they want the fairy-tale beauty and emotional depth that Disney used to master so effortlessly.

The overwhelmingly negative reaction to the first trailer should have been a warning. But Disney ignored the criticism and pushed forward anyway. In the end, they have delivered a film that fails to satisfy either old fans or new audiences. Snow White is a story rich in symbolism, beauty, and timeless storytelling-all of which have been completely discarded in this remake. Those who want to experience the true magic of Snow White should simply watch the 1937 original.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White trailer promised, in capital letters: ""The classic story comes to life"". Nothing could be farther from the truth, as the more Disney makes these live action movies, the more they look like animated movies made by CGI. To the point that human actors feel almost out of place. It's as if the animation gene of the studio was too strong and it wanted to take over.

The other trend in Disney live action movies that is also visible in this Snow White is that they seem dominated by the guys making the cheap Disney Channel musicals, or the people making the Broadway shows. Highly choreographed musical numbers designed and filmed as if we were just sitting in a theatre, as opposed to with a film lens.

Beyond that, as live action Disney remakes go, Snow White is better than average without ever being great. To those criticizing the movie for steering too far from the original, it's probably worth reminding them that the original is a tale from 1812, and the 1937 Disney movie took plenty of liberties relative to that original already. So yes, it's okay for Snow White to be of latin descent, for Prince Charming not to be a prince, and so on. We expect filmmakers to adapt stories over time, and for whatever reason they want.

The issue with Disney remakes is actually that they don't evolve enough relative to the animated version. In that regard, Snow White tries harder than others. And the new scenes are where the movie seems to find its wings and is able to breathe. But it's weighed down by the requirements to reproduce entire scenes from the animated film. Long scenes where it's clear the filmmakers are checking boxes and don't have their hearts in it.",5/10
"I went to the theater with an open mind, trying my best to set aside the original story and avoid making comparisons. I just wanted to watch a movie, immerse myself in the story, and be entertained for two hours.

The result of my experience, still avoiding deeper analysis or comparisons, is that it's an okay movie. Nothing exceptional. The storyline is okay, the acting is okay (for a Disney princess movie), though there are some weak spots in the plot, as well as in the way certain moments of tension are developed and resolved. But I wouldn't call it terrible, far from it.

If I were to start making comparisons and analyzing the producers' choices (some of which I find downright ridiculous), my opinion would drop significantly. But I don't think it's fair to dislike, or hate, the movie for what I consider the wrong reasons.

This movie should be judged for what it is, on its own terms. And my honest take? It's an okay movie. Nothing remarkable, but far from awful.

Don't hate the moovie for the wrong reasons. It's just a movie.",5/10

"Who gave Rachel the role of Snow White?!? She should have been the Evil Queen instead! She is not suited at all to play Snow White The casting choice just doesn't fit and It feels completely off and doesn't capture the essence of the original character.

Why try to change a story that was already magical??The classic Snow White is beloved for a reason! The innocence, the charm, the fairytale magic-none of that seems to be here. Instead, it feels like they are forcing unnecessary changes that take away from what made the original so special...

Disney has always been known for creating timeless stories and movies that generations have loved but this version of Snow White just feels wrong It doesn't honor the magic of the original, and the casting choice makes it even harder to connect with. Why fix something that was never broken?

Gal Gadot, amazing as usual.",5/10
"Generally I do like cartoons or semi-cartoon child movies like here - almost no blood, no bad language, no s*x or anything.

But the movie was just meh.

The plot was unintriguing,the main character even didn't know she liked (or not) the thief, the thief was so plain and so simple, IDK.

There were no funny jokes and the only two things I have enjoyed - the songs (actually, I saw in Greek language, so for your language it could be different experience), and the dwarfs.

The decorations were cheap, everything else felt cheap as well, even though the movie has a budget...

Do I recommend it? No, I don't. After publishing in your streaming platform you could give it a chance, but just don't go to the cinema.",5/10

"Snow White is definitely nothing groundbreaking or new. It is a rather dull and formulaic remake, which doesn't reach the heights of other Disney remakes of recent years. It is still a perfectly fun family film, which is generally well made. It is mainly let down by the poor performance by Gal Gadot as the evil Queen, as well as a jumbled and formulaic storyline whi h definitely drags towards the end.

The old songs are very charming, and the new ones are fairly memorable (if a little bit dull and formulaic). The stand outs in the film are Rachel Zegler as Snow White, and Jonathan, who provide fun and perfectly good performances. The romance between the two is a bit forced, as there is not a huge amount of chemistry.

The dwarves are also somewhat of a stand out in the film, especially dopey. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the CGI design of the characters, but they added a lighthertedness to the film, and were well voiced. I especially like the Hi-Ho sequence, but in general, the dwarves were quite forgettable.

Overall, this is a perfectly fun family film, which is let down by some poor performance, and a forgettable storyline. It is definitely not as bad as some have made out on this app.",5/10
"My daughter liked it, but I didn't. She didn't watch the original Disney version of the cartoon, let me clarify that.

The Seven Dwarfs - they look a bit scary, in my opinion. But my daughter thought they were cute.

The actress, as it seemed to me, overacted, very much.

The ""Prince"" more or less played and did his job, but also almost on the same level as Snow White.

The stepmother - that was something. A charismatic character, although she is a villain.

The film ended quickly, starting well, but ending - ""oh, it's time to finish already, let's tell you faster."" That's the feeling I had. But I think children don't care. Just a fairy tale to watch.",5/10
"In summary: Audiovisual carries the film and it's definitely a decent family watch.

In detail: Despite the rewrites from the original Snow White story by Disney, this film still somehow pulls off a little touch of magic in its world. In this case, the two major things that uplift its quality are the music and CGI. The music really delivers its authentic feel with modern ensemble, performed beautifully by the casts. The CGI on the other hand, dwarves especially, really bring them out to life without leaving important resemblances of the classic.

Unfortunately, performance wise, Rachel Zegler (debatably) actually has it, theatrically. Definitely not for the look, character, and soul of Snow White. On Gal 's end, she has performed absolutely terribly, expressionless and unnaturally forced as usual (usual being her performance in other films). As for the other casts, they perform normally well.

There is no expectation to be awed and surprised, but this film is worth watching to have a quick joyride to fill up your day.",5/10

"I watched this movie in the theatre today and the main reason I wanted to watch this was because of the horrible reviews for this movie.

I watched it and it wasn't as bad as people said. I think 1/2 stars is a bit harsh. Around 3-5ish would've been more realistic. Some of the acting was off and they dramatized the scenes more than needed. The songs were okay but that wasn't the main problem. The main problem was the plot of the story, i get that this is a remake but the plot was uhm.. questionable. And the things going on wasn't very necessary for the movie. I think they could've definitely casted other actors instead. Gal Gadot's acting was pretty good compared to the others. As mentioned before, the acting was off at some times and felt a bit unrealistic, but it's a fairytale so..

Well in the end, the movie wasn't as bad as I thought but they could've improved the script and casting a lot. I gotta give this a 5.",5/10
"I really tried to watch this movie without the controversial topics in my mind. Rachel Z. Gave a solid performance with a beautiful voice but it was way too many new song introduced in the movie. I was not bothered by the cgi Although some place it looked a bit cheap, reminded me of once upon a time tv show. The ending was rushed, that shouldn't sing all the time so could have a better ending. My main problem was the evil queen. The costumes not always gave me the vibe , she shouldn't sing or give her a scary song at least but mainly it was not scary enough. It was meh. Overall it's an okay movie seen worse.",5/10
"""The Little Mermaid,"" was bad for so many reasons mostly because the animation when you were ""under da sea,"" in the original film, gave character, and a red talking Caribbean crab was hilarious and memorable, but looked stupid in the live-action movie 2 years ago, with no expressionism expect raising eyes when terrified. Alas, Disney forges on with their never-ending crusade to bring all the old classics to the big screen. ""Snow White,"" is the latest incarnation and while Rachel Ziglar portrays Snow White in an acceptable role, the rest of the film feels tired as if we have seen it before. Scenes feel elongated, much like ""Mermaid,"" suffered severely, and it is Disney's way of extending an 89-minute cartoon to a full length that drags and, unfortunately, this film suffers as well.",3/10
"When you have a cartoon that is iconic as Snow White there is no way to mess it up. Everything is already there, you just have to sell the nostalgia. Seems easy right? Well, not for this new Disney we've been seeing lately.

Somehow they messed it up. Both because the movie is just bad (script, feeling) and because they wanted so hard to be different.

At least that was achieved, different being bad...

Both Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot don't seem to fit the roles, the dwarfs being CGI, the excessive use of CGI, everything looks out of place...

I'm not a huge fan of these new live-action remakes but this is without a doubt the worst one so far.",1/10
What an amazing take on SnowWhite and the Seven Dwarves. They kept the story line true to the original and added some great stuff. The Dwarves were great and the animation was spot on. What a great story line they added them in the story the whole time which was wonderful. The Queen's clothes were a great added bonus as well. The main actress who played SnowWhite was an amazing singer and I feel she did an amazing job. Her clothes were great and looked just like the original. I'm so glade they kept a lot of the original songs that we all love to sing. I left the movie with my 8 friends and all of us were singing.,10/10
"My daughter was so excited to see this movie, and to be fair, I'd not read the reviews prior to taking her to see it. Utterly awful attempt for something that would and should have been an amazing film to reimagine. I've never been to see a Disney film where the reviews are correct. Stick to the original, which as my daughter described it perfectly just now, ""I like the films Disney made where their main characters are people I wanted to be in my dreams, and they came to life on the screen'. Sad times for dad's like me with this kind of poor material to suffer their children through! I'm hoping the new Lion King is not also ruined!",1/10
"I don't even know where to start with this disaster. As someone who grew up loving the original Snow White, I was cautiously optimistic about this remake. But wow... Disney somehow managed to suck all the magic, charm, and fun out of a classic and replace it with a preachy, lifeless mess.

What went wrong?

Where are the dwarfs? One of the most iconic parts of the story is gone, replaced by random companions that have zero personality or chemistry. Why even call it Snow White if you're just going to rewrite everything?

Snow White herself... yikes. The lead actress might be talented, but her take on the character is cold and unlikable. Snow White is supposed to be kind and full of wonder, but here she's just... kind of smug? Instead of inspiring, she just lectures everyone.

The Prince? Nope. Apparently, romance is outdated now, so they just removed the Prince altogether. The original story wasn't about a girl waiting to be saved-it was about kindness and believing in love. Now, it's just a dull hero's journey with no heart.

The visuals are shockingly bad. Disney has the budget for breathtaking CGI, but somehow, this film looks cheap and lifeless. The forest is bland, the creatures look weird, and even the costumes feel off.

The songs? Forgettable. You won't be humming any of these tracks after leaving the theater. They pale in comparison to the classics, and none of them have that Disney magic.

Final Thoughts: Disney really needs to stop butchering their animated classics. This wasn't a reimagining-it was a soulless, joyless cash grab that completely missed the point of Snow White. If you love the original, save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.",1/10
"Don't waste your time with this movie. Disney missed a huge opportunity by not using real people to act as the seven dwarfs and instead using CGI to create the dwarfs and make them look out of place. The acting was not well done, and the songs were not a good representation of the movie's new intent that they were trying to pull off instead of the original movies old theme/meaning. The movie should have incorporated more aspects of the original instead of trying to completely remake a Disney classic with a different meaning. Overall, it's not worth your time or money, and I wouldn't recommend it to friends or family.",1/10
"The 2025 Snow White film presents an intriguing storyline that successfully reimagines the classic fairy tale while incorporating a unique blend of animation and live-action, reminiscent of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?. The visual style creates a fantastical world where animated elements seamlessly interact with human characters, giving the film a distinct and imaginative feel.

However, one notable aspect of the film is its heavy reliance on singing. While music plays a crucial role in many Disney adaptations, this version may feel overwhelming to viewers who prefer a more balanced approach to storytelling. The sheer amount of singing at times detracts from the narrative, making certain scenes feel drawn out rather than progressing the plot effectively.

Despite this, the film's resolution is satisfying and uplifting. The ending brings the kingdom's people together, emphasizing unity and the power of hope. The Evil Stepmother faces a fitting downfall, as she is ultimately banished, ensuring that peace is restored to the land. This resolution leaves the door open for further storytelling, making it a strong candidate for expansion into a television series, much like Once Upon a Time. With a rich world and well-developed characters, a series spin-off could explore deeper lore, side stories, and the continued adventures of Snow White and those around her.",5/10

"Snow White (2025) is what happens when a studio takes a timeless classic, runs it through a corporate filter, and forgets to add soul. Snow spends most of the film giving motivational speeches like she's auditioning for a leadership seminar, while the iconic dwarfs are now a vague group of randoms with zero charm. The Evil Queen isn't scary-just mildly irritated-and the magic feels as forced as the dialogue. Even the poisoned apple looked bored. A film trying so hard to be ""modern"" it forgot to be good.

Honestly, the poisoned apple had the right idea.

Save yourself the time-re-watch the cartoon or take a nap. Both are more fulfilling.",1/10

"A nightmare of a film. Disney has ruined a historic classic. An utter trash movie!

They've destroyed the magic that this classic once had! What's Disney's problem with creating a new story with whatever narrative they prefer, instead of remaking a tale told by our parents and grandparents? It makes no sense. Changing the narrative of a story that enchanted generations is disgusting.

The worst movie of the last 30 years! Think of a bad film, now multiply it by 10,000, and you'll get a better idea of what Disney produced. There was no need for seven dwarfs! They could have changed that... and there didn't need to be a witch either! Just change the whole story already!",1/10

The way Rachel and Gal Gadot portrayed their character made me hate snow white.

The movie didn't represent what Disney movies are all about. It didn't have the warm feeling of watching a Disney movie. Sometimes it's better to keep the original and not make a remake. It's not a beauty and beast version it was a big miss. The actors as well didn't fit the job and also it didn't create what Snow White represented in the original version . Next time Disney should check who they hire for there films bc not everyone fits that movie especially a family movie like Snow White. People don't want to see real live villains playing a magical Disney fairy tale movie. People want happy endings with real good people.,1/10
"The new Snow White movie was a complete letdown. It tossed out the heart of the original story and replaced it with a messy plot, bland characters, and forced dialogue. Snow White herself felt more like a lecture than a heroine, and the visuals-while clearly expensive-lacked the magic and charm that made the classic so beloved. It tried so hard to be different, it forgot to be good. Instead of modernizing a fairytale, it stripped it of its soul and left us with something cold and forgettable. Even the dwarfs, once iconic, were reduced to afterthoughts. In total this movie wasn't great, and the fact is that it will never be great, and that's a sad reality.",1/10

I saw this movie only because my AMC A-List pass allows me a movie pass every week. I thought it would be one of the worst movies I would ever see but I cleared my thoughts and went to see it anyway.

Oh boy, was I disappointed and this is after expecting nothing. The acting was AWFUL, the CGI dwarves are unnecessarily terrible. It's crazy Disney releasee this movie. Wow.

I didn't feel like I was watching a movie from a major movie company. I was NEVER sold from the beginning that the main actress was actually Snow White. Everything went wrong for this movie. Absolutely everything.

I don't even write reviews, but I had to say something to help others not waste their hard earned money.

"Good movie, Bad acting Gal Gadot.. truly evil queen in real live.. no more gal gadot movie, terrible casting to evil queen.

Gadot was ""truly awful"" in the role, adding: ""This could have been a fabulous role with a different actress.""

I enjoyed the movie and Rachel but Gal Gadot ruined it truthfully, her acting... her singing was diabolical

Gal Gadot's performance in Snow White is, easily her worst,"" another said.

Rachel Zegler gives a genuine movie star performance in Snow White, and that carries it further than you'd expect. Great vocals and so effortlessly charming!

Rachel Zegler's endless charisma convincingly positions Snow White as a strong, pure-of-heart leader even when the script isn't pulling the same weight,"" it said. The titular princess simply pops from the screen, especially when Zegler is allowed to put her stamp on the original film's iconography. The same cannot be said for Gal Gadot, who turns in what might be her worst performance to date. Gadot is woefully miscast as the Evil Queen, unable to sell us on the glamour, fierceness or true camp of a classic Disney villain.",1/10
"The new Snow White movie is a delightful watch that brings a fresh twist to the classic fairy tale, making it a perfect choice for kids. The vibrant visuals, catchy songs, and heartwarming storyline are sure to keep young audiences entertained from start to finish. It's a movie that beautifully blends nostalgia with modern elements, giving both children and adults something to enjoy.

What I don't quite understand is why so many people seem to dislike it. It's clear that the filmmakers aimed to create a fun, family-friendly experience, and that's exactly what they delivered. Sure, there are changes to the original story, but that's part of the magic of reimagining classic tales - it makes them more relatable and engaging for today's audience. It's a movie meant to be light-hearted and enjoyable, so why nitpick every little detail?

People these days seem to find fault with everything, no matter how well it's made. Sometimes, we just need to let ourselves enjoy the ride, especially when it's meant for kids. Snow White is a great movie that succeeds in doing what it set out to do - entertain and bring joy.",10/10
"Do not watch this. I mean it. Unless, of course, you haven't seen the original-but even then, what are you doing with your life? Go watch the original first. Trust me, it's better. It's like watching a sequel to a movie you didn't even know existed, or reading the last page of a book and pretending you understand the plot. This is like showing up for the final exam without taking the class. Like eating a microwaved burrito when there's a gourmet feast next door. Go. Watch. The. Original. I'll still be here when you come to your senses. So do not waste your money and time to watch this bad remake.",1/10

"The new Snow White remake is a complete disaster. It abandons the charm, magic, and timeless appeal of the original in favor of a dull, uninspired story. The casting choices feel forced, the CGI is lackluster, and the script is painfully bland. Gone are the beloved characters and classic moments that made Snow White a fairytale icon. Instead, we get a joyless, soulless film that alienates fans. The attempt to modernize the story strips it of heart and nostalgia. Rather than celebrating a classic, this remake disrespects its legacy, leaving audiences disappointed and frustrated. Don't waste your money.",1/10
A bit hard to know where to start with this one. I suppose the opening will do. Firstly an explanation of the intent of the movie is given in the opening piece followed by a forgettable song and plastic acting. Anything good will let the movie tell it's story. The watcher will learn this as the movie decelops. The opening is followed by a story that is not Snow White. Call it a different name but this is not Snow White. The magic has been lost and what follows are just more forgettable songs and poor acting. The effects look good but this is 2025 and with the budget this should be expected. The storyline was confusing and not the quality of Disney from even 10 years ago. Would highly recommend to avoid.,1/10

"I've never seen an actress with such a small range of emotions and facial expressions. I could not make myself finish the movie.

Hollywood please stop hiring her, she needs to get her acting skills in order or give her some side hustles to practice because this is unwatchable.

I'm not sure if I can call her an actress, I know her as a model so I'm a bit confused.

Dense expressions, one dimensional tone, almost every line is delivered like she is in a shampoo commercial.

She lacks personality and character playing the Evil Queen. All in all 1/10, she literally ruined the movie for me, unfortunately.",1/10
All they had to do was follow the original Snow White. Is it bad that it's not the 1970s but I wanted snow to be saved by the prince. What wrong with a little delusion. They should have never released this movie. It's soo bad I really feel bad for Disney bro. Disney remakes have been good in the past now with they changing the story from the original is bad move on their part. I just wish it was ANYONE OTHER THAN Rachel lmao bc imagine doing publicity for your movie and all you had to say about it was negative things is crazy. Also the prince wasn't even fine. Like who the was that bc he did not look good.,1/10
"All I can say is: If you want to watch this movie driven by curiosity, don't do it. It's not worth your time.

There isn't a single enjoyable scene, everything feels unnatural. I felt like I had been eaten by the Uncanny Valley Monster. Nothing to learn here, nothing remarkable, nothing at least decent (and I swear I was looking for something decent).

I can't believe how much money was spent on this. There's always people complaining on how much we spend on space missions and similar fields... When are we going to talk about how much is spent in such disastrous, unnecessary movies? I swear a bunch of cosplayers and a room design expert would do a better job. Value your time and do not watch this movie.

1/10, and it would be 0/10 if possible.",1/10
"Watched it today and honestly loved this live-action remake! It was magical, new and fresh. I loved the story and the new songs were perfect. The casting was amazing, Gal ate her role and Rachel was a great fit for snow white! It had adventure, romance, comedy and good elements of action (if it had more action it would have been even better but still was great!). Overall, I enjoyed it A LOT!

The songs were insane. I have never heard Gal's voice, she was awesome and Rachel's voice was pure and sweet. Loved the chemistry between Rachel and Andrew as well. It was better than I hoped. Worth watching in my opinion!",10/10
"The 2025 *Snow White* is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time, and frankly, it makes me want to rip my eyeballs out. It's nothing like the original, and Disney has completely missed the mark. The film is poorly produced, with lackluster special effects and a script that feels like it was written in a rush by someone who didn't understand the story. The casting choices are just as bad-none of the actors or actresses bring any charm or depth to their roles, making the entire experience feel flat and lifeless. It's hard to understand why anyone would want to remake a classic in such a terrible way. The movie is a blatant cash grab with no heart or soul, and it's clear that Disney just doesn't care anymore. I don't know what else to say, other than this is a complete disaster of a film that no one should waste their time watching.",1/10
"I had certain expectations, and this film failed to deliver literally every single one of them. Please, people-do not waste your time watching this. It was made with completely wrong intentions, lacking any genuine heart or creativity, and the cast quality is absolute zero. There's not one memorable performance or moment worth mentioning. I genuinely believe this remake will disappoint and break the hearts of countless children (and adults) who cherished the charm, warmth, and magic of the original storyline. Simply put, this adaptation is a hollow shell of what it could have been. Please put this movie down.",1/10

"I found it to be an entertaining option for a weekday escape. Rachel Zegler's singing performance was notably impressive and added a delightful touch to the film. The movie offered humorous moments, though I did notice a shift from the classic Disney magic to a more homemade style in acting and filming. While I felt that Rachel Zegler's soundtrack outshined Gal Gadot's performance, this might reflect differences in ""production"" style rather than a commentary on individual ""talent""! Overall, it's a fun watch if you don't have to pay for it. Deff not with the money that you have to pay in the cinema.",3/10
"If you thought Snow White was a fairytale, think again - this version is a cinematic horror story. From the opening scene, it's clear: this isn't a reimagining, it's a demolition job.

Let's talk about the lead actress - and I use actress very loosely. Her performance is so wooden, I half-expected forest animals to start building a nest in her hair. She delivers every line like she's reading it for the first time - from a cue card - held by someone who gave up halfway through. Charisma? Nowhere to be found. It's as if she was cast for the role of ""girl who doesn't want to be here,"" and boy, did she commit.

The chemistry between characters is non-existent, the plot feels like it was written during a coffee break, and the dwarfs? Don't even get me started. They're less ""whimsical companions"" and more ""NPCs who glitched through casting.""

Visually, it's overproduced yet somehow cheap-looking. Emotionally? As empty as a poisoned apple core.

If this film had a mirror on the wall, it would shatter out of embarrassment.",1/10
"Snow White (2025) is a bland, soulless remake that strips away everything magical about the original. The CGI-heavy world feels lifeless, and the forced modern updates make the story feel preachy rather than empowering. The performances lack charm, especially with a Snow White who seems disconnected from the role. The dwarfs are gone, replaced with unmemorable side characters. The weak script lacks humor and heart, making it a dull experience. Disney had a chance to reimagine a classic with care, but instead, they delivered an uninspired mess that no one asked for.

Do not recommend. Leave this one out.",1/10
"The movie is almost nothing like the original. How could it be a remake while it being a completely different story? Costumes were extremely cheap, and everything looked so heavily filtered. The budget was NOT used wisely as my eyes were literally being blinded with the amount of cgi going on. Why not hire ACTUAL little people instead of making them cgi??? Gal Gadot's acting was insufferable. Snow white didn't even look like snow white, no red lips! Overran won't be recommending, your better off watching the original snow white instead of this fake replica of what is supposed to be snow white.",1/10
"This remake reminding me to appreciate more classic version of the movie that released back in 1937. Not to mention, the actress who played Snow White seems very rude and disrespecting the classic version instead of taking that movie as inspiration to create the movie in modern version, however as i watch the movie, this new one doesn't even 1% better than the classic one. Never ever trying to remake something that doesn't reflect the original version. Take a note, if you are excellent actor, you should understand how to create the character more lively and make the audience remember the classic one but loving also the new one without comparing which one is better. Sorry not sorry 👎🏻",1/10

"I took my children to watch this on the weekend. I can honestly say I would not recommend it. The acting was wooden, and the story line deviated too much from the original. There's modernising and then there's utterly ruining. This was the latter. I remember seeing the original as a child and loving the story. It was a proper fairytale. My husband and to my son out of the cinema as he was bored and my daughter (aged 9) and I waited it out but both agreed it wasn't worth persevering. It's time from my life I will never get back. I can't believe Gal Gadot got a star. Her acting was the worst of all the characters in the film. Go and do something more interesting like watch grass grow.",1/10
"I give points for Rachel's singing. But I wonder, if the thief wasn't good-looking, would the princess still like him? It doesn't really make sense. The story is boring. The actors kept saying this and that would change, which made me expect more, but in the end, it was still dull and still relied on men as always. That's contradictory.

The CGI animals were adorable, and the Seven Dwarfs were well done. The witch's performance was weak, with no real menace. As for the lead actress, she felt unnatural, overacted, and lacked Snow White's gentleness. She interpreted everything with resentment.

In the end, the best thing about the movie was the dwarfs' Heigh-Ho song.",2/10
"Live action where you dont see real dwarves? Outrageous, why would such a classic take away the chance to spotlight great dwarf actors. I really love snow white's original soundtrack. ""Wishing well"". ""Someday my price will come"" they are such incredibly beautiful songs that are sooo sooo hard to sing. Adriana Caselotti's singing was pristine, heavenly!! When i saw that the trailer didnt even show any good music, i knew it was going to be terrible. But I am NOT SURPRISED. Disney's 1937 portrayal was soo perfect that a huge mistake was bound to happen, just because of the pressure of how amazing it was. So maybe the makers indeed became blind to how terrible it was. What i find so heartbreaking is this started filiming in 2019. This movie is worse far worse than all of the movies that have a low rating. It was just so incredibly idiotic. And I did not like Gal Gadot's portrayal either. Ugh.",1/10
"We want to see the live action version of the story we love. We don't want creepy/terribly executed CGI. She is an alright singer, but that's all this has going for it. New songs were terrible. Acting 4/10. Happy my ticket was free. For future love action adaptations agar you can do is watch the cartoon, then remake it with real people. I know that night be a difficult concept for you since you want everything to make a statement, but right now just try and make a good movie. I'm now terrified for the Moana and Lilo live action adaptations. Stitch is gonna be a poodle isn't he? I digress. 0/10 will never watch again.",1/10
Now most people have already said what i was going to say. But if you just need a quick summary of how bad this movie is. This review is for you. First of all the acting is horrible. The story is meh but im humble i like to give the movie a chance no matter the reviews. But if i had to be honest the story wasn't good either it was same as horrible. The girl who played snow white was the worst part of the whole movie. Why because it felt like they weren't even trying to act. I think I don't need to say more this movie has to be worse then mademe web lol. But all and all i would suggest you avoid this movie if you're like me who hate bad acting.,1/10
"Disney has officially lost the plot. This ""reimagining"" of Snow White strips the story of everything that made it iconic-no magic, no heart, and definitely no charm. The lead is completely unconvincing, and the script is painfully dull. Instead of updating a classic with care, they injected it with awkward messaging and zero soul. It's preachy, flat, and joyless. Honestly, it feels more like a bad parody than a real film. A complete waste of time, money and nostalgia. They took a beloved classic and completely butchered it. Congratulations Disney you finally managed to make a movie no one is going to pirate.",1/10
"Starting this review is alot like being surrounded by enemies in the sense that I can fire in any direction. The CGI was better in the first Blade movie in the 90s, the acting from lord Farquad wouldnt have got the part in a highschool production of Peter-pan. The costume was grabbed from a Party city out of business sale. The music was a reflection of an animal screaming for its last breath. This movie felt like a creepy uncle was filming it in his basement. If there was anyone else in the theater I'd have staged a walk out. Instead I just walked out, reflect on this flop, disney do better. Disgusting.",1/10
"I couldn't connect with the world or the characters.

At this point it's safe to say that this film is suffering from...money laundering.

I believe they are just purchasing these ideas just to move cash around unnoticed but forget to think that if your stories are badly written and produced it's going to start becoming a bit suspicious over the years.

Why does Disney want to change stories from the past and instead embrace some of its more interesting themes and memorable moments.

I don't get it.

This has me very concerned for the next Tron film and I hope that it's a much better film than what this was.",1/10
Love this movie better than the orginal Rachel is so beautiful and very talented perfect for the kids great live action remake gal Gadot was amazing as the evil queen she was terrifying very evil and wicked love the sounds they are so memorable they have been stuck in my head for a while the cgi dwarfs were actually really cute and funny I got used to them after a while they were so sweet and kind .love the cgi animals too they were so cute and sweet really amazing love story as well Rachel and Johnathan had great chemistry I love Rachel this is definitely one of the best Disney live action remake I've seen .,10/10

"I was deeply disappointed by *Snow White*. The plot was sluggish, predictable, and lacked the charm of the original. The acting was flat, with Snow White delivering a wooden performance that failed to evoke emotion. The visuals were overdone, making the film feel like a CGI-heavy spectacle rather than a magical fairy tale. The soundtrack was forgettable, and the pacing was all over the place. Overall, it missed the mark entirely, failing to capture the heart and magic of the classic, leaving me bored and frustrated. Very bad movie do not even deserve 1 star as it has the movie star which does not deserve hall of fame.",1/10
"After the main actress was hating on original movie and story about Snow White I didn't expect anything of the movie. Disney's latest attempt at a Snow White adaptation proves that not all fairy tales deserve a live-action makeover-at least not like this. Instead of a whimsical, timeless story, we get a hollow, soulless reimagining that strips away everything magical in favor of a forced, uninspired narrative. Snow White herself feels less like beloved princess and more like a generic protagonist thrown into a story that barely resembles the original. The film tries so hard to be ""modern"" that it forgets the importance of genuine character development. The supporting cast is forgettable, the humor falls flat, and the CGI? Overused to the point where you wonder if anything real was actually filmed. The worst part? The heart and wonder of the original are completely missing. It's as if the filmmakers were more concerned with making a statement than telling a compelling story. The Evil Queen, usually the highlight of any Snow White adaptation, feels underutilized, and the so-called romance is nonexistent. Disney has done better. They can do better. But this? This isn't a fairy tale-it's a cautionary tale about how not to do a remake.",1/10
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is painfully overrated. The story is painfully simple, the characters are one-dimensional, and Snow White herself is insufferably naive. Her high-pitched voice is grating, and she spends most of the film helpless, waiting for a prince to save her. The dwarfs provide some charm, but their repetitive antics get old fast. The villain, while iconic, barely does anything. The animation may have been groundbreaking in 1937, but today, it feels dated and lifeless. The pacing drags, the songs are forgettable, and the entire movie lacks depth. A truly overrated classic that does not hold up. 1/5.",1/10
"Zawg what is this 😭 This is absolutely baffling. The sheer absurdity of what's happening right now is beyond comprehension. Every second feels like a new level of confusion, like watching something so unintentionally chaotic that it loops back around to being entertaining. It's almost impressive how effortlessly it defies logic, yet here we are, witnessing it unfold in real time. Words can't even do justice to the sheer bewilderment. It's as if every expectation has been thrown out the window, leaving only the raw, unfiltered question: how did we even get here? Nothing makes sense, and yet, somehow, it continues.",1/10
"Disney really took a timeless classic and said, ""Let's strip away everything people loved and see what happens."" Well, what happened was a cinematic train wreck so bad even the Seven Dwarfs packed up and left before the premiere. The Evil Queen didn't even need a poison apple this time just showing people the trailer was enough to put them to sleep. At this point, even straight-to-DVD sequels are looking down on this mess like, 'Damn, at least we had a plot. If this movie was a fairytale, the moral would be: Just because you can remake something doesn't mean you should. Watching this movie felt like biting into a beautiful, shiny apple, only to realize it's made of cardboard and regret. Disney took a beloved classic, squeezed out all the charm, and replaced it with a script that feels like it was written by someone who skimmed the Wikipedia summary of the original.",1/10
"I fully appreciate that fantasy allows for creativity-it can be reimagined, adapted, and even completely transformed.

That being said, I never expected Walt Disney Studios to take such a bold approach in reinterpreting a beloved, cross-generational classic like Snow White.

I fully support the creation of new stories with diverse characters and fresh narratives that reflect modern perspectives. However, some classics hold deep sentimental value across multiple generations. As someone who grew up with Snow White, this film is ingrained in my core memories, just as it is for those before and after me. Classics like these should be preserved and cherished, as they reflect the artistic and cultural values of their time.

While inclusivity and fresh perspectives in storytelling are important, significant alterations to such an iconic film risk diluting its original essence. A balance should be found-one that allows for new narratives to flourish without rewriting the legacy of timeless classics.

Dear Disney we want new stories, new characters, not a mutilation of crown jewels movies such as Snow White, Cinderella, or Fantasia.",1/10
"It's extremely hard to like to title character. The live action ""remake"" has no living dwarves, doesn't remotely follow the storyline, and is a convoluted mess. The only reason I'll even give it a 1-star is for Gal Gadot's performance, and even that's a stretch. Children shouldn't have this be their first representation of a classic story and phenomenal Disney staple. Hands down, this is the worst film Disney has ever put their ""magic"" into. I cannot understand how anyone thought this was a good script. Considering Greta Gerwig wrote ""Barbie"" and destroyed that, I shouldn't be surprised. Disney needs to go back to the drawing board - no pun intended.",1/10
"I went to see Snow White with my 7-year-old, and we both absolutely loved it. From start to finish, it was a magical experience. The songs were incredibly catchy-we caught ourselves humming a few of them on the way home-and they added a lot of charm and energy to the story. The production was stunning, with beautiful costumes, sets, and visuals that really brought the fairy tale world to life.

What stood out most for me as a parent was how well the film balanced its tone. It had just the right mix of light suspense and gentle humor, without being too intense or frightening for younger kids. There were a few moments of tension, but nothing that felt overwhelming or too dark. My child was fully engaged throughout, laughing at the funny parts and wide-eyed during the magical moments.

Overall, it was a wonderfully age-appropriate film with a classic fairy tale feel and a heartwarming message. A great choice for a family movie outing, especially with younger children.",10/10
"The trailer for this movie isn't worth your time, let alone the whole movie. I genuinely regret wasting my time on this, and I seriously wish I could give it zero stars. This is one of those rare cases where even one star feels like too much. The main actor delivers a completely uninspired performance, full of overacting and cliché lines that make it hard to take anything seriously. And even if we generously ignore all the nonsense surrounding him (which we absolutely shouldn't), we're still left with laughable CGI dwarfs that look like something from a bad video game. The plot is shallow, the pacing is off, and the visuals feel cheap despite all the CGI.",1/10

"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs may be a classic, but it hasn't aged well. The story is painfully simplistic, and Snow White herself is a passive, one-dimensional character with little agency. The Prince has barely any screen time, yet somehow, his kiss magically solves everything. The dwarfs provide some charm, but their humor feels outdated. The pacing drags, and the film's old-fashioned morals seem out of place today. While historically significant, it's far from Disney's best and lacks the depth and engagement of later animated films. The animation, while groundbreaking for its time, now feels stiff.",1/10
"It's truly hard to even get into the movie when I couldn't get past the fact that it looked like a human trying to act and sing in front of the polar express movie backdrop! One thing was asked if you Disney, and that was give us snow white... I'm not certain what this is but it's not Snow White! The storyline, the actress playing sw, and all the cgi make for an atrocity not the beautiful sw movie I grew up watching. Yeah, I know the whole point was to get as far as possible from the original that made Disney a legend...BIG MISTAKE. Either this will be Disney's last live action remake or they will finally accept they must stick to the original because this movie is a sorry excuse!",1/10
"I have never been more disappointed with a movie in my life. While the lead actress is talented and pretty (just not in this role), she simply doesn't fit as Snow White. The seven dwarfs look awkward and cringeworthy, making it hard to take them seriously. And what on earth did they do to Dopey? You can't even feel Grumpy as ""Grumpy"" anymore.

The new songs? Completely forgettable, adding nothing to the film's charm.

And the costumes??? A total disaster. Some children's birthday outfits look better than what Snow White wore here! They didn't even bother to style her hair properly, it looks like she was intentionally made to look unpolished.

If they wanted to showcase female empowerment, they should have just created an entirely new movie instead of forcing it into a Snow White adaptation. This remake fails to capture the magic of the original and ends up being a poorly executed mess.",1/10

"If you want to watch Snow White watch the original not this trash listed as snowwhite. The cgi looks like a low budget polar express that was found in a trash can. Disney needs to bring back making movies in Technicolor. 200 million on this completely blows my mind. I'd rather watch Rosie O'Donnell play Snow White, I'd rather fall asleep in a puddle face down than experience this movie. I'd like to think Disney will stop with this vomit they call remakes and invest in creative ideas. I get art is subjective but are we really going to classify this as art. I could wright better acting then what's shown in this movie.",1/10
"The visuals feel completely unnatural-the sets look cheap, the CGI animals are unconvincing, and The Dwarves are so poorly executed that I'm at a loss for words.

I always try to approach films with an open mind, even when they receive heavy criticism, hoping they'll prove the skeptics wrong.

However, after watching this, I'm genuinely shocked. Considering the immense budget and effort put into it, the final product is unbelievably disappointing. The entire film is painfully awkward to watch, and I'm struggling to find anything positive to highlight.

Another major misstep is the costume design. Snow White's outfit doesn't translate well on screen, and the hairstyle choice is baffling-what were they thinking?

One of the biggest letdowns is the performance of the lead, which falls flat and will likely attract criticism for all the wrong reasons.",1/10
"I absolutely loved the movie! They finally brought back the magic of colors, making every scene visually stunning and vibrant. The songs are incredibly captivating, adding an extra layer of charm and emotion to the story. Of course, like any movie, it has a few flaws, but that's completely normal and doesn't take away from the overall experience. The film does a fantastic job of retelling the story in a fresh, engaging, and entertaining way. It's the perfect introduction for a new generation. Remember, the target audience is children, so enjoy it with that in mind!

Raquel brilhou e interpretou a Branca de Neve de forma excepcional. Ela manteve a doçura que a princesa nos apresentou no original.

Raquel shined and delivered an outstanding performance as Snow White. She maintained the sweetness that the princess showed us in the original.",10/10
"I much preferred Sigourney Weaver as the evil queen. Is every Disney movie now also written by the same person who writes every Marvel movie???

Everything Sigourney brought to the role is so much more robust than Gal Gadot. This is less to do, likely, with Gadot as an actress and more to do with the slipshod team behind the movie. Though Gadot's performance is certainly not memorable.

From the obvious wigs on Snow White to the bland writing and acting, it is clear to me that Disney is about to just make future productions with AI. Sadly, this will probably be their last stab at the Snow White story.",1/10
"I found the movie quite cringe-worthy at several points. The acting felt unnatural, especially between the hero and villain, and I just couldn't connect with the main character. The development was really lacking. If they wanted to stray so far from the original story, they should have just created a new character and given them a proper arc. It seemed like they were trying to capitalize on existing emotional investment, and skipped the part where they actually develop the character for this movie. Adding to the issues, the pacing is erratic, with scenes dragging unnecessarily or rushing crucial plot points. The dialogue also feels unnatural and exposition-heavy, further distancing the audience from the characters and their struggles.",1/10

"With 30 minutes left of the movie I found myself drifting to sleep. Gal Gadot's awful acting is what kept me entertained during the hardest times of staying awake.

I am unsure what they meant by ""fair"". Perhaps im too dumb to understand. But the Queen wanted to be fair but was not fair in the slightest. I'm sure a random peasant would've been named fairer over the Queen if they weren't going by beauty.

The CGI of the dwarves creeped me out. Very uncanny.

Honestly was inspired to watch the movie because of how much ppl hated it. I actually have a soft spot for bad movies but only when they are entertainingly bad.",1/10
"Ah, Snow White-a film about kindness, courage, and standing up to injustice. Too bad none of that translated off-screen.

Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot take center stage in this lifeless, CGI-drenched remake, delivering performances as hollow as their silence on real-world oppression. Zegler's Snow White talks a big game about being a leader, but leadership apparently stops where uncomfortable truths begin. Meanwhile, Gadot's Evil Queen is more believable than ever-maybe because playing a villain is easier when you're already ignoring human suffering.

The visuals? Bland. The storytelling? Sanitized beyond recognition. The heart? Nowhere to be found. Disney had the chance to bring something fresh to the table, but instead, they served up a lukewarm mess with a side of corporate cowardice.

If you're looking for a fairytale that actually embodies justice, look elsewhere. Because in this kingdom, the fairest of them all are the ones who dare to speak up-and these two certainly don't qualify.",1/10
"I have seen bad movies before, but this one takes the cake. It's like the director threw a script, a camera, and a handful of confused actors into a blender and hit ""puree."" The plot? Nonexistent. The dialogue? Painful. The acting? I've seen more convincing performances in kindergarten plays.

The pacing drags like a snail stuck in glue, and when something does finally happen, it makes zero sense. The special effects look like they were made on a 20-year-old computer running Windows XP. And the soundtrack? It's either completely inappropriate or so grating that it feels like punishment.

By the time the credits rolled, I felt like I had lost brain cells and precious time I will never get back. If you ever find yourself considering watching this, do something more enjoyable-like staring at a blank wall.",1/10
"When Disney announced a live-action adaptation of Snow White, many fans hoped for a faithful retelling of the beloved fairy tale. Unfortunately, this version strays so far from the original that it feels like a completely different story-one that lacks the heart, charm, and timeless magic that made the animated classic so special.

The Main Character: A Major Letdown

The biggest flaw in this adaptation is Snow White herself. In the original, she is kind, gentle, and full of hope-traits that define her strength. However, in this version, she is completely unrecognizable. Instead of embodying the grace and optimism that made her a beloved character, she comes across as overly rebellious, dismissive, and even unlikable at times. Her attitude feels forced, as if the movie is trying too hard to make her a modern heroine while completely missing what made her special in the first place.

A Story That Loses Its Magic

The original Snow White is a story about innocence, kindness, and the triumph of good over evil. This adaptation, however, strips away the fairy tale charm, replacing it with unnecessary changes that add little to the story. The dwarfs, the prince, and even the Evil Queen lack the depth and presence they had in the original. Instead of enhancing the story, the film seems determined to ""fix"" things that were never broken, resulting in a version that feels hollow and disconnected from its source material.

A Disservice to Childhood Memories

For those who grew up loving Snow White, this adaptation is nothing short of disappointing. It takes a classic tale and twists it into something that barely resembles the story we all cherished. Instead of celebrating the original's timeless themes, it undermines them, leaving behind a movie that fails to capture the magic, warmth, and wonder of the classic fairy tale.

Final Verdict: 2/10

This live-action Snow White is a perfect example of why some stories are best left untouched. Instead of reimagining the tale with love and respect, it distances itself from everything that made the original so enchanting. If you're looking for nostalgia and fairy tale magic, it's better to revisit the 1937 classic rather than waste time on this disappointing remake.",1/10
"I'm just tired of these remakes. I'm done please no more they retroactively ruin the original somehow. The casting is terrible and the CGI is a huge step back. I hope it disappears like the failed willow streaming series. Disney needs to stop and reevaluate the direction they are going. This movie entirely missed the mark. There was no nostalgia nothing to improve the original. It was just a loss. Lost money and lost time. Magic mirror on the wall, how much will Disney stock fall? I guess if I had to say something positive about the movie it would be that I really appreciate the older movies better.",1/10
"Disney has done again a wonderful job. This movie is beautiful and magical, I've spent an incredible time. This remake gives a touch of modernity to the original movie of 1937.

The cinematography is incredibly well done and the original story is followed while giving a more modern and beautiful ending.

Rachel Zegler is perfect as Snow White and she is giving us a wonderful and magical performance.

The costumes are very elegant and full of colours that I absolutely love and give us an immersive environment.

This movie has a palette of different emotions that is worth seeing.

Congratulations to all the cast and crew.",10/10
"I just watched the 2025 Snow White remake, and I'm still reeling from the experience. Unfortunately, it was a mixed bag, with Gal Gadot's cringeworthy performance as the Evil Queen being a major letdown. Her acting was stilted, and her singing was downright painful.¹ It's a shame, really, given her talent in other films.

On the other hand, Rachel Zegler was an absolute delight as Snow White. She brought a newfound depth to the character, and her singing voice was stunning. She's a true star, and her performance was the only thing that kept me invested in the movie.

The film's visuals were also a bit of a disappointment. The CGI was overused, and the dwarves looked more like creepy dolls than lovable characters. The pacing was also off, with some scenes feeling rushed and others feeling like they dragged on forever.

Overall, I'd give Snow White 3.0 out of 10 stars. While Zegler's performance was a highlight, the rest of the movie was a bit of a mess. If you're a die-hard Disney fan, you might enjoy it, but otherwise, it's a skippable remake.

"Total disaster of a movie.

Destroying Disney magic that is the basis for the equity that Disney has been famous for ever.

From every aspect of this creation it's a disaster.

Leave perfection and excellent uniqueness like this alone.

The story is the story. It doesn't need updated. Its charm and storytelling is its authentic spirit of adventure and daring.

It's a story lived by millions and millions of people over time. It's a great example of Disney at its best from 1937. They would be better celebrating the original film in full. Spend time creating the Snow Whites of today. New stories. Great tale telling.",1/10
"I thought I give this movie a shot because of the bad reputation it had even before the launch.

Snow White was one of the core fairytales from my childhood and I still hold it dear. Despite that I couldnt watch it till the end. The only good actor was Gal Gadot and that was not enough for me.

As for Snow White, I couldnt symphatyze with her for the first time in all adaptations. I just really dont like this actress. One part may be her vibe that I dont like, the other thing may be her apearance. She just doesnt look like a Snow White to me. If the roles were reversed with Gal, I think it would be better.

I also didnt like the CGI dwarfes. I dont like so much CGI in a movie. Imagine if Tyrion in GOT would be a CGI character...",1/10
"Took my 3 Daughters to watch this, they were heartbroken by the end. Will never pay to see another Disney film ever again.

Rachel is not a great actor and it really shows in this movie, the modern changes made to the film removed what people wanted to see.

With a budget of 300 Million Dollars, it beggars belief that Dsiney would allow this film to be made so poorly.

The only thing we enjoyed in the film was Gal Gadot's performance but we felt she was too pretty to portray an evil witch.

Very disappointed in Disney, this was abysmal from start to end. How can such mistakes be made? We're they not involved in production?

Avoid and save your money.",1/10
"Might be one of the dullest, unoriginal, and lackluster movies to date. A senseless remake that sours the apple of the original. Stay clear of this film.

Disney's latest attempt at reviving a classic proves to be anything but enchanting. Stripped of the heart and charm that made the original Snow White a beloved masterpiece, this lifeless adaptation leans so heavily on CGI that it feels more like a video game cutscene than a magical fairy tale. The over-polished visuals fail to capture any real wonder, and the uninspired performances don't help either.

This is yet another Disney misstep, proving that not every animated classic needs a live-action remake-especially one that lacks creativity and soul. Do yourself a favor: skip this CGI-heavy disaster and revisit the 1937 masterpiece instead. At least that one understood what magic actually is.",1/10
"Disney's 2025 Snow White is a baffling betrayal of the 1937 masterpiece. The original's charm-Snow White's kindness, her cleaning the cottage, the dwarfs' wash scene, and ""Someday My Prince Will Come""-is gutted. Here, she's not the gentle soul we loved but a preachy leader who doesn't lift a finger for the dwarfs. They don't even save her from the Queen; that iconic rescue is swapped for a flat rebellion subplot. The CGI dwarfs look creepy, not endearing, and the absence of the prince guts the fairy-tale heart. Why butcher a near-perfect classic for this joyless, unrecognizable mess? 1/10.

Oh and Snow White is not names Snow White because of a snow storm... ridiculous...",1/10
"This movie is nothing short of a complete and utter catastrophe! The acting is so atrocious it's almost painful to watch, with performers who seem to have no clue what they're doing. The storyline is a jumbled mess of absurdity, lacking any coherence or depth, and it feels like it was thrown together by someone with no imagination. The special effects are laughably cheap, looking like they were slapped together on a budget of pocket change. Honestly, sitting through this film is an exercise in frustration-you'll find yourself itching to turn it off within the first few minutes. I can't fathom why anyone thought this was worth the funding; it's a total waste of resources and an insult to anyone who values their time. Avoid this trash at all costs!",1/10
"I tried to give this new Snow White adaptation a chance, but honestly, it was a total disappointment. The movie lacks the magic and charm of the animated version, with unnecessary changes that only take away from what made the original story so special.

The script is weak, the dialogues feel forced, and the characters have no charisma. Snow White, instead of being a lovable character, feels generic and lacks the sweetness that defined her. The visual effects are nothing impressive, and the cinematography is dull and lifeless.

If Disney wanted to modernize the story, they did it in the worst way possible. Instead of bringing something new and exciting, the movie ends up feeling like a watered-down, soulless version of an untouchable classic. Definitely not recommended.",1/10
"Just as great as the original, if not better! Stunning visuals and amazing music. A new story with one of my favorite Disney princesses! This new Snow White theme can inspire today's generation of little girls for as many decades as the original has. Can't wait to being friends and family to see it again! Watching it in IMAX the colors just flew off of the screen to create the perfect picture before us. WoW! Dont believe the box office, it's definitely worth seeing on the big screen. I think a lot of people are waiting to see it once it has come to streaming services, but this is one that can definitely use our support in the theater!",10/10
"I went to this movie to prove myself if all the hate around the movie and actors makes sense or not. Abstraction of characters, the film does not respect the story, focuses on irrelevant things and the graphic production is very poor. For such a beautiful story, I expected more.

And as for the actors, it was cringe the way they tried to play the roles 🤡Specifically, Lines that should have been strong, to convey the emotion beyond words, to transpose you into the story.... They were said like a poem at a school celebration. The songs that were sung.... Better not. 🤣

It looks like a movie made in the basement!! 😁",1/10

I will save my cinema tickets and put it in a frame and maybe it will have value in the future.

This movie proves creativity at its finest in the opposite direction. They could just change the name of the movie into ""Snow ball belle balls and the wicked nicest itsy bitsy witch queen"" and tag it as parody just to save it and people will move on and understand.

This movie brings people together, creates account just to give comments, suggestions, violent reaction, feed back, compliments and hoensty.",1/10
"Snow White has always been a good movie to me so I was absolutely over the moon when I heard they were making a live action version. Even seeing all the hate around it I figured to give it a go and hoped for the best, wrong decision. I don't have anything against the lead actress and her acting was quite well but it just didn't fit snow white in the slightest in my opinion. This is ofcourse not her fault since she's just there becuase it's her job and she needs money but I definitely think that the producer screwed up big time with this, the movie had a lot of potential to be very good but it just isn't.",1/10
"This movie was pretty bad. The songs were not great and weren't very memorable. The story also wasn't great, there was no character development, like I couldn't tell you anything about the characters other than (maybe) their names. The script was, once again, not great it just not great it just felt flat. The only part I really enjoyed was the fact that my party and I got to joke about it.

It also felt rushed, especially the ending. It was like they ran out of time and had to cram it all in the last 10 minutes.

(There was also a ton of CGI) While I enjoyed the time I got to spend with my family and friends while watching this, I don't think I would watch it again or recommend it for others. I wanted it to be better, it just wasn't 🤷‍♀️",2/10
"I went to see the Snow White remake last Thursday with high expectations, but instead, I found myself stuck in a mess of tacky visuals, subpar effects, and a complete lack of imagination.

Marc Webb's direction was, at best, a textbook example of average filmmaking-a lesson in how to mishandle a classic story. His approach lacked any spark of originality, to the point where even over-the-top silliness would've been a welcome change.

The seven dwarfs? They weren't even real actors-just a bunch of CGI creations that couldn't muster an ounce of personality. Their awkward musical performances felt like a kazoo crashing a symphony orchestra: jarring, misplaced, and a failed stab at adding some flair that only highlighted the film's overall messiness.

Rachel Zegler's take on Snow White was dull and lifeless, swinging between forgettable and stiff. Then there's Gal Gadot as the evil queen-her over-the-top smugness came off as forced and unconvincing. The total absence of chemistry between the actors just made the film's flaws even more glaring.

From the weak performances to the awkward musical bits, every part of this movie worked together to deliver something creatively empty and unintentionally laughable. It's baffling how a film can take a cherished story, waste its potential, and disrespect its audience all at once.

Do yourself a favor and skip this one-it's a clear sign that not every remake deserves a shot.

An utterly miserable letdown in every way.",1/10
"Honestly, this remake was such a letdown. I went in hoping for a fresh take on the classic, but it just didn't work. The story felt awkward, and the characters didn't have any real personality. It's like they tried too hard to change things but forgot what made the original so special in the first place. Even the visuals, which should've been a strong point, felt bland. There were moments where it seemed like things might improve, but they never really did. The emotional moments fell flat, and the overall pacing dragged on longer than it needed to. I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't get into it. Definitely wouldn't recommend - the original is way better.",1/10
"The movie is so bad that it is even uncomfortable to watch. From the very beginning, it fails to capture any interest or provide any form of entertainment. The plot is weak and predictable, the characters are poorly developed, and the acting is subpar. The pacing is off, making the movie feel like it drags on forever. The technical aspects, such as cinematography and sound design, are also lacking, further adding to the discomfort. Overall, this is one of the most disappointing experiences I have ever lived, and I would not recommend it to anyone. It was a complete waste of time and effort. Do not waste your money or time! PLEASE.",1/10
"I don't know what went wrong here, but this actress's performance was one of the weakest I've seen in a long time. Every line delivery felt forced, with no real emotion or depth. It was as if she was just reading from a script without understanding the character at all.

Her facial expressions were either over-the-top or nonexistent, making it impossible to connect with her role. Even in dramatic moments, there was no sincerity-just awkward pauses and unnatural reactions. It honestly felt like she was miscast or didn't put in any effort to make the character believable.

With so many talented actors out there, it's baffling how she ended up in this role. Hopefully, this is a one-time flop, but if this is the best she can do, maybe it's time to consider a different career.",1/10
"I took my grandkids and I am 64 years old. I must say that this is a must see amazing movie and Rachel Zegler is truly a star. This movie really touched my heart. Disney should be patted on the back in bringing this heart warming movie back to life. Standing ovation from me!

The movie had rich characters and the 7 dwarfs were so realistic mixing characters with realistic type characters that was a special touch. The story line, colors, characters were all carefully choreographed. This was a masterpiece in my opinion showing how good conquers over evil. You will laugh and even cry in this perfect movie. I would suggest all families and the entire family go perfect for age 2 to 102.",10/10
"Walt is probably rolling in his grave as the current generation at Disney butchers his masterpiece on the alter in the name of appeasing an audience that quite frankly does not exist for their products anymore. Its so deliciously ironic that the movie that made disney's reputation, will be the movie to ruin disney's reputation. As someone who loves and respects fairytales as being the foundation of storytelling culture, I found this movie to be particularly egregious as it spits contemptuously all over the source material, while being the most ugly any person with eyes has ever had the misfortune of seeing.

Hey disney, next time just rerelease the original in theatres instead.",1/10
"A Complete Disaster

This movie is an absolute trainwreck from start to finish. The plot is incoherent, riddled with clichés, and drags on with no sense of pacing. The dialogue is lifeless, filled with awkward exposition and cringe-worthy one-liners. The acting is stiff and unconvincing, making it impossible to connect with any of the characters. The special effects, if any, are either overused or laughably bad. Even the editing feels sloppy, with jarring transitions and unnecessary scenes. Whether it's action, drama, or comedy, this film fails spectacularly in every way. Easily one of the worst movies ever made.",1/10
"I wish I could turn back 1 hour and 49 minutes so I would not be able to watch the disaster that is Snow White (2025).

There is nothing positive, or anything remotely nice that I can say about this film.

The CGI was extremely unrealistic and looked AI-generated , lack-luster performance, the acting was stiff, the singing was the only good part about it, and it was still forgettable either ways. Do not get me started on the dwarves.. The movie felt empty and artificial without any charm or liveliness like the original. Somehow, a movie in 1937 managed to outdo a movie in 2025, impressive. Humans have truly regressed, and this movie is living evidence.",1/10
"The very souls of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm must now be trapped in eternal torment, unable to find peace in this universe after witnessing this cinematic atrocity. Those who have experienced the timeless brilliance of the 1937 classic will understand the sheer mastery it took to craft a film so rich in direction, music, casting, and storytelling-one that defined family entertainment for generations.

Yet, this 2025 abomination spits in the face of that legacy, an insult so profound that it exposes not just the filmmakers' incompetence but their utter contempt for the original vision. It is a disgraceful display of arrogance, a testament to the depths of creative bankruptcy. If you believe a story needs change, create your own. Write something original, bring something fresh to the world. But desecrating a masterpiece because your mind lacks the capacity for genuine creativity is not just foolish-it is an unforgivable crime against art itself.",1/10
"I have only one thing to say. What the hell is that?

I get that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a classic, but honestly, it does not hold up. The story is ridiculously simple, Snow White has zero personality, and the prince is so irrelevant he might as well not exist. She spends most of the movie singing, cleaning, or being helpless until she falls into a coma-great role model.

The dwarfs are mildly entertaining at first, but their gimmicks get old fast. The only real standout is the Evil Queen, but she barely gets any screen time before meeting a rushed and anticlimactic end.

Visually, I'll give it credit for being impressive for 1937, but the animation feels stiff, and the pacing drags. If you didn't grow up with it, there's really no reason to watch it now. Disney has done way better since.",1/10
"This movie is the absolute worst dinsey movie ever! The actress is completely out of place, it's written so badly and lazy and they changed everything that made the original Movie so good. Also Details like the dress and the dwarfs look so bad. I hope people don't actually spend their hardworking money on this joke... Please try to avoid this Movie at all cost!! It's a big waste of time, and there are better Disney movies out then this one, for example the original Snow White Movie. It's way way better then this one. Disney do better. I mean it's so bad I even need to write an review, wich I personally never do.",1/10
"It's diabolical, honestly, I can't understand how so much money and so much time has gone into this, the final result is cringe worthy. It is an absolute shocker, I am stumped to find any positives.

It looks and feels so artificial, the sets, the animals, as for The Dwarves themselves, I have no words to express my feelings there.

The biggest catastrophe, not what I was expecting if I'm honest, the worst offender, Gal Gadot, she looks sensational, but her performance, she's going to scoop some unwanted awards it's fair to say.

What I wasn't expecting, was just how poor the costumes would look on screen, Snow White's just doesn't translate very well, the hairstyle, what were they thinking?

Disney, what on Earth have you done?",1/10
"Unbelievable, breathtaking, captivating! The live-action ""Snow White"" (2025) is a cinematic masterpiece that redefines the standards for Disney remakes. Rachel Zegler delivers a masterful performance as Snow White, perfectly capturing the essence of the character. Her presence on screen is mesmerizing, and her voice resonates with a purity that deeply moves. The musical sequences are spectacular, featuring new songs that become instant classics. Gal Gadot, as the Evil Queen, delivers a powerful performance, adding layers of complexity to the iconic villain. Marc Webb's direction is impeccable, combining stunning visuals with an engaging narrative that honors the original while introducing contemporary elements. This film is an absolute triumph and a celebration of the magic of cinema.",10/10
"So let's get this out of the way first, yes this movie is boring, no Rachel Zegler is not the reason why this movie is middle of the road. Gal Gadot is completely miscast as the evil queen, at no point during the movie did I find her performance threatening or menacing. A piece of cardboard would make a better villain than she did. Gal does her best to cover up her heavy accent to deliver a more even keel voice, but it's all for naught. It's even more painfully apparent during the musical numbers. Gal delivers such a flat, off key performance, it's brutal to watch.

Honestly, Rachel Zegler is the bright spot of the movie, she delivers a passionate performance as Snow White, you can tell how dedicated she was to the role. When Rachel and Gal are on screen together, it truly shows you how absolutely outclassed Gal is by Rachel's talent. She embodies Snow White completely, delivering grace even at her lowest points.

Turning the prince into the leader of a bandit gang was an enjoyable change of pace, Andrew Burnap is charming enough, and gives the role of ""the Prince"" more depth. He lacks a commanding presence though and he ends up looking like a guy just chasing around Snow White.

Making the dwarves CGI was a choice. I would have preferred live action performers myself. Each one has its own personality and they are all charming in their own way. Funnily enough, outside of Snow White, the dwarves feel the most fleshed out of the other characters. It's never explained why they mine for gems but considering how obsessed this version of the Evil Queen is with jewels, I thought it would have been a nice twist if they thought they were mining for Snow White's original family and in fact were mining for the Evil Queen. It would have given them more stakes in the movie and a stronger reason to ally themselves with Snow White.",5/10
"A total disaster, a classic destroyed to meet the demand of a sick society!!! From the selection of the cast to the changes in the story it has lost the essence and the enchantment that the original story presented. Modifying the classics in an effort to comply with a chunk of society that will never be content is just ludicrous. I applaud that they are bringing in new talent to the big screen, but this is just an overkill an over acted effort to fit in. We watched the movie prior to see if it was something our kids would be allowed to view and came to the conclusion that we will not expose them to it.",1/10
"Rachels acting falls short for all the talk she made coming up to this and the tearing down of the original. She is very bland in acting its like she has no idea what to do or how to even express emotions with how fast she just shifts between them. Also snow is meant to be kind and caring the kingdom is meant to be supportive of her because of how much she has shown she cares and helps them yet all Rachel has managed to do it make it so even tho snow is the main character who we are supposed to want to root for, i wanted the apple to win just cause of how annoying it was being

I took my whole family to go see it and no one liked it , so much money went into this film and was not impressed the acting was horrific only thing I enjoyed was my buttery popcorn and pickle, Also my nachos with some warm cheese , I just hope Disney learns from this flop of a movie and hires better actors for the next Disney classic that we all know and love. The ending was ridiculous from start to finish actually and the singing wasn't all that great as well there was times I caught myself dosing off as well , just do better next time Disney please.",1/10
"I genuinely created an account for this review. The film feels like it was made by a committee trying to fix things that weren't broken, and yet, still somehow managed to actually break everything. With Disney nowadays, it's just been flop after flop. I wonder the amount of brain damage you have to suffer to one day think ""Ah yes, let's hire Gal Gadoodoo, the ONE actress that CANNOT act"". Beside her acting the plot is cringe and subpar, honestly this movie, in my opinion is genuinely WORSE than the live action Dragon Ball Evolutions movie. Another live action remake of a classic that ends up being terrible.",1/10

This movie is one of the worst things I've ever seen. It's like they took everything good about the original and threw it in the trash. The acting is lifeless, the writing is beyond awful, and the changes they made are just embarrassing. It feels like the people who made this have never even heard of Snow White. The pacing is a mess, the visuals are ugly, and the whole thing is painfully boring. It's not just bad-it's insulting. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. If you value your time, stay far, far away from this disaster.",1/10
"Honestly, you hate to see it and hear it.

Disney completely butchered Snow White. Everything and everyone is just bad-there's no charm, no magic, no soul. If this had to be made, it should've gone straight to the DVD graveyard and stayed forgotten. The acting is flat, the visuals are hollow, and the tone is all wrong. Tasteless, empty trash with zero heart or respect for the original. It's a lazy cash grab and a disgrace to the legacy. Disney should be embarrassed.

It insults fans of the classic and feels like it was made by people who didn't care. A soulless mess that no one asked for and no one needed.",1/10
"Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs may be a classic, but it hasn't aged well. The plot is paper-thin, with a passive protagonist who does little more than sing and wait to be saved. Snow White's personality is as bland as her dialogue, making her one of the least compelling Disney leads. The pacing drags, and the prince-who barely appears-has zero character development. Meanwhile, the film's old-fashioned gender roles feel outdated and cringeworthy. Even the animation, while historic, lacks the refinement of later Disney films. Nostalgia aside, Snow White is dull, shallow, and overrated.",1/10
"I highly recommend this well-executed movie based on the classic Snow White story, which beautifully incorporates musical elements. The film is an excellent choice for children and young people, as it emphasizes important life values and virtues such as kindness, courage, honesty, and the importance of friendship. The enchanting musical numbers not only enhance the story but also make the lesson of good triumphing over evil even more memorable. It's a captivating and heartwarming experience that both entertains and educates young audiences. I watched it with my sister and movie brought us back to childhood.",10/10
"Snow White is a grotesque, soulless cash-grab so devoid of charm it makes the Evil Queen's poisoned apple look appetizing by comparison. This live-action travesty takes the 1937 masterpiece-a film that once defined wonder-and stomps it into a CGI-smeared puddle of corporate cynicism.

Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, meanwhile, slinks around like a discount store mannequin, her thin voice and thinner presence turning a legendary villain into a parody of itself.

This isn't a remake; it's a cultural crime scene, a $270 million disaster that proves Disney's once-magic mirror now reflects only greed and mediocrity. Avoid it like a plague-ridden fruit basket-zero stars, and may it rot in the woods forever.",1/10

"Disney's new Snow White is a complete disaster. The film lacks the charm and magic of the original, replacing beloved characters and themes with dull, uninspired storytelling. Rachel Zegler's performance feels lifeless, and the script is riddled with forced dialogue and cringeworthy moments. The CGI is inconsistent, and the changes to the classic story feel unnecessary. The dwarfs are gone, the humor is flat, and the heart of the original has been stripped away. It's a soulless, forgettable mess that disrespects its source material. Fans of the 1937 classic truly deserve far better than this..",1/10
"For the record, I do like Marc Webb as a director. Great filmmaker with generally a great creative mind and eye for detail with whatever material he deals with.

With Snow White, I was generally able to look past the casting. Rachel Zegler is a fine actress and the way Disney is, it should have been no surprise they would go in that direction and it's not her fault they paid her millions to play the role.

However, the big red flag was the cast, crew and Disney themselves almost denouncing the original film as outdated and offensive, cause lord knows that's how you promote your remake of a film that your studio made. They also seem to forget that it wasn't even Disney's story, it was based on a classic fairytale.

Plot-wise, this is fairly close to the original. It's brand new, so I'll refrain from giving away too much. However, if you've seen Disney's recent remakes or reimagining's, you could probably guess what things they might have kept and what they changed to ""modernize"" this in their way.

With that said, the changes did cause me to roll my eyes a bit. Particularly with the changes to the Prince...sorry Jonathan and Snow White herself. Gal Gadot does really well as the Queen and kind of made me wish for a while movie about her instead of the remake. She is actually the one that kept this film partially afloat for me.

The Seven Dwarfs, for the most part were a big relief. They kept them far closer to the original than I and so many thought. So, that was a relief.

So overall, I'll give this a 3/10. I forgave it a little more than most because my kid did love it, so that counts. However, it's easy to see why many weren't forgiving because these changes from Disney are getting a little tiring and I think this film proved how burnt many are feeling from these lackluster remakes.",3/10
"Utterly Disappointing. One star is generous. From the stilted dialogue to the bizarre casting choices, this film was a trainwreck. Gal Gadot's performance was badly wooden, devoid of any real menace or charisma. It felt like she was reading lines off a cue card, and her singing was...questionable. The rest of the cast fared no better, seemingly lost in a sea of poorly executed CGI and a script that felt like it was written by an AI. Avoid at all costs unless you enjoy watching beloved stories get butchered. Overall this movie is some because of Gal Gadot and her appalling performance 🎭 I want my time back.",1/10
"Instead of trying to diminish the original, it would've been better if they had created a new character and storyline. With the film's budget, they could've easily brought something fresh and unique for moviegoers to experience. Disney seems to keep turning out the same hollow narrative, which isn't smart or entertaining. These attempts to cash in on nostalgia are growing old. The message is falling flat and it's time they stop rewriting classic fairytales. Hopefully, this is the last attempt at doing so, and they focus on creating something original next time. What a missed opportunity to showcase the talent they brought to the film.",1/10

This is a live action remake, with a plot and animation style which are not intended for young children.

It's child-friendly, and children can enjoy the colors/the singing, but by no means were children thought of as the primary target audience of this film..

The casting (while certainly diverse), is not hurt by the casting of Rachel Zegler, nor Gal Godot.

Disney would be far better off making a much darker film (for adults), than they were here (straddling the line between a film for adults and a film for all ages).

These live-actions are not popular with young children, yet they are not dark enough for the adult audience which grew up with these films and who actually wants to see the films.

Children have a 5-20 minute attention span and generally appear to care more about the colors and cartoon/animation... Yet, Snow-White a long with The Lion King (amongst others) lack a meaningful story to keep the adults entertained.

Either go back to fully animated films, or make these films for a PG-13 audience (since children are not watching more than a few minutes of any of these live-action remakes).",10/10
"I saw Snow White this afternoon with my Aunt and older cousin. We all loved the movie, as did everyone in the theater who clapped when the movie ended. Rachel was a wonderful Snow White and her voice is angelic! I loved the new songs, especially Waiting on a Wish and the duet A Hand Meets a Hand. They are so beautiful. I had been listening to them on repeat on Apple Music. I got used to the CGI dwarves quickly, and everyone including adults and children were oooing and awwwing over the cute CGI animals. The only downside was unfortunately for me Gal Gadot's performance and singing. It was tolerable though. I definitely want to see the movie again. I would highly recommend!",10/10
"I took my 9 year old daughter to watch Snow White over the weekend and was expecting the worse given all the negative reviews here. I ended up really liking the movie and my daughter had a great time too. I think people have rigid expectations on how every detail should be based on their childhood memories, but the movie really doesn't deserve all the negative reviews. If you are going with an open mind and do not expect too much from it, then I guarantee you will have a good experience. All the kids and their parents in the theatre were applauding at the end of the movie. This is my honest opinion and I am going to stick with it.",10/10
"It's not a ten but apparently this movie is vein rated all sorts of crazy things, so I'll join that trend.

Rachel Zegler is amazing, wonderful singer, and adds this beautiful classical Disney princess animation to her acting - if you see the film, you know what I mean.

The movie has some great new original songs, that are propper bobs.

The movie has all the original story points, and just expands on this - which I think is what the remakes should do! Be nostalgic but also bring something new to the party.

Gal Gadot was miscast - this part could have been so fun with the right actress. I think issue is Gal Gadot can't get the evilness across without beeing cartoonish sit in leather chair and pet a cat kind of way. But when she has to be big and campy, it like she's worried about looking silly and then by default falls a bit flat.

This movie is really fun, and a solid 7, it's supposed to be fun not life changing.",10/10

"Snow White was such an amazing movie. They took the aspects that we know and love about Snow White and expanded on them to provide a more well rounded movie. I loved the character development of Snow White. I think the 7 dwarves looked great and were so cute, especially Dopey and his character development as well as all the quick quippy jokes they make in the film. I loved the addition of the new bandit characters. Also I'm obsessed with the new music!!! Good Things Grow, Hand Meets a Hand and Waiting on a Wish have been stuck in my head for days. Definitely go see this movie! I can't wait to hear the music in the parks.",10/10
"The movie is worth watching, and maybe is a little childish but it needs an opportunity. The songs are beautiful and it has to be made clear that it is a musical and for people who don't like musicals it will be more than obvious that this fact is just one more reason for them not to like the film.

The movie is very well represented and it's almost the same as the animated one.

It is very short, which is ideal for children so they won't be bored.

In conclusion, i think the movie is being very critized and it doesn't deserves it.

If you can give it a opportunity, it would me great, and you will like it as you liked all the other love action Disney movies.",10/10
"One of the best remakes. Expands on a lot of material from the original, adding fun musical numbers! Snow white's character in particular got a lot more interesting and a bit of depth. The shallow description of her from the original is completely absent here and even her name got more interesting. I also enjoyed Dopey's character arc and Jonathan. Gal Gadot's evil queen, surprisingly, wasn't all bad. Her performance made her look like a genuinely insecure and shallow person, finding beauty only in jewels and costumes. The poisoning scene was really great too, and her death was something else.",10/10
"I don't understand why all the negative reviews, it almost seems like people all of sudden are now screen writers and directors lol. This is one of the most Disney movies ever made, I say this cause it made me feel like I was at Disneyland.

I can understand why people think the film does not convey the feelings of the original animated movie but this movie deliveries a more deeper and meaningful concept, kindness is at the center stage. Snow White wanted to carry out the legacy of her family by being kind to people and showing mercy to everyone while pointing out a kingdom's prosperity cannot be accomplished by solely the ruler but by its people.",10/10
"Absolutely adorable, Rachel is so cute & such a talent her costumes are lovely and the Evil Queen is lovely and scary at the same time ,this film is visually stunning and the cgi dwarfs are adorable not to mention you fall in love with Dopey. The soundtrack is top notch each song is beautiful, fun and catchy and I must admit I cried a couple times. It really is magical it made me excited about my up coming trip to Disneyland. I hope you all enjoy it like we did.everyone who contributed to this film deserves an award.every seat was taken at the movie theater we went to and everyone clapped at the end , bravo Disney.",10/10
"Was pleasantly surprised, brilliant live action version of the story , Gal Gadot plays the evil queen perfectly, a few little changes to the story to bring it into the modern day , but it worked perfectly, four of us went to see it age from 12 - 52 and we all enjoyed it . They kept a lot of the songs , like hey ho and whistle while u work which was lovely to see and had us all singing along in the cinema. Rachel Zegler was perfect for the part Snow White and the dwarves where very cute , its overall a very heartwarming story told wonderfully by Disney and it did need a more up to date version and the original is showing its age.",10/10

"The film had amazing imagery and the acting was great. It was very cute and perfect for the whole family. The film had had excellent screenwriters and there were definitely a few good chuckles. The music and score were great and really complemented the movie. Overall, the movie was fantastic and enjoyable. We all really enjoyed it. Rachel Ziegler is charming and did a fantastic job! I'm unsure why so many people want to hate on this remake when it was really good. I'd prefer to see more original content but for a remake, it's good. The movie is great for the family and I would highly recommend it.",10/10
"Andrew Burnap and Rachel Zegler really shine in this charming film. The songs are a delight, and we had many laughs from the witty dialogue. All around a great time. This is my favorite so far of all the Disney live action remakes. I hope we see more of these two stars in the future. I'm not sure why there has been so much controversy around this movie - but it didn't stop me from enjoying it. There are a lot of nice references here to the original film while also feeling like a fresh and interesting take on the fairytale. The sets are visually stunning as are the costumes. Fun for the whole family.",10/10
"I took my son to watch it and he loved it. He wants to add the music to his Playlist of songs that we have for him. He's inspired to be kind, ""Fearless, Fair, Brave, and True"". I could not ask for anything more from a Disney Princess.

I believe a lot of people who are negatively commenting about the outer appearance/superficial beauty of the actresses have lost the true moral behind Snow White. The Evil Queen was always more beautiful in appearance; she was enchanting just with her looks. Snow White's beauty comes from within. The true moral of Snow White is that ""vanity will not take you far but kindness will"".

All this to say, if you go into the movie expecting a Disney princess movie then that is what you get.",10/10

"The new Snow White was absolutely magical, and I loved every moment of it. The breathtaking visuals, stunning cinematography, and heartfelt performances made it a joy to watch. The reimagined story added fresh depth while still honoring the classic charm. The music was enchanting, and the characters felt more real and relatable than ever. It beautifully blended nostalgia with modern storytelling, creating a film that was both moving and visually spectacular. I left the theater smiling, completely captivated by its magic. A must-watch for fans of timeless fairy tales. It was a visually stunning and emotionally captivating experience. The film beautifully reimagined the classic tale while staying true to its heart, with a fresh and engaging story.",10/10
Well we enjoyed it. I think to understand the story you need to read the villians book set where it has the book Fairest of them all. Because there is more to the original story. Then you would understand how good is the movie and the story line where they say the Fairest is not what you look like on just the outside beatuy comes with in. I think people need to see it first judging two. The music is great to. They explain where her actually name comes from. Everyone who acted in the film did job. But there will always be people who do not like things and judge it before reading books and movies.,10/10
"Watched with my 11 year old and 6 year old and we all loved it. It is fun, well done, full of action, funny, and the colors and story telling is beautiful. It has nothing controversial, or violent. The actors are great in it and the heart of the story remains the same. Definitely recommend to watch.

My kids loved the funny parts, and the end. My 6 year old got slightly scared in the middle, but for one scene only. Both say they would watch it again and again.

I liked the twist in the story, and bringing more life to how snowwhite is saved. And loved the ending, much more empathetic and nicely done.",10/10
"Disney's live-action adaptation of ""Snow White"" is a delightful reimagining that captivated both my nine-year-old daughter and me. Rachel Zegler shines as Snow White, bringing depth and charm to the beloved character. Her portrayal adds a modern twist, portraying Snow White as a confident leader, which resonated with my daughter. The film's musical numbers are enchanting, seamlessly blending classic songs with new compositions. The timeless tunes like ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work"" are beautifully rendered, while the new songs add fresh energy to the narrative. My daughter loved the songs so much, we had to listen to the soundtrack on the way home.",10/10
"The movie did a wonderful job paying homage to the original animation while adding some modern twists. Rachel Zegler as well as Emilia Faucher (young Snow White) were incredible. Gal Gadot was outstanding. Hadley Fraser was terrific. Lorena Andrea blew me out of the water once again. Andrew Burnap was magnificent. The rest of the cast was extraordinary. The costumes and the sets were spectacular. The songs and the dance numbers were mesmerizing and beautiful. I was laughing, smiling, whistling, and felt a little scared at the same time. It was one of the most wonderful things that I had ever seen.",10/10
Honestly worth the watch. Despite changes for a modern audience Snow White still tells an authentic story that stays true to the animated original. Adding more to the story in a just way. Such as the back story for the live interest that isn't really in the original animated and while fantastical and disneyfied brings out that disney magic that is true to these fairytale stories. Gripping you from the start with some outstanding songs that stick with you. Would pay to see again and again. Doesn't quite take the top spot for me but it's almost the best so far. (Not counting The Lion King Live action as that's just 4K Animation IMO) 10/10.,10/10
"I've been a fan of the original since I was a little girl, snow white has always been my favorite disney princess so I had hype expectations for this movie but all my fears left my head the moment the opening scene happened. All I thought for the whole movie was how much I wished my grandma lived to see this movie come to life on live action. The only negatives in this movie was those uncanny cgi dwarves & the evil queens acting. Her whole character this movie was go girl give us nothing! However rachel's voice and acting made the whole movie enjoyable. I loved the romance change for andrew + the new sons. The whole movie was a great new twist on a classic movie that came out almost 100 years ago. Go rachel zegler don't let them get to you!",10/10

"The movie was nothing short of breathtaking-a visually stunning and emotionally rich tribute to the classic. Every element, from the cinematography to the performances, captured the magic and wonder that made the original so beloved. The music, in particular, was a highlight, with each song feeling as though it belonged on a grand Broadway stage, elevating the film's charm and emotional depth.

Yet, despite its brilliance, some continue to insist, ""Don't touch the classics,"" as if adaptations somehow diminish the legacy of the original. Ironically, many seem to forget that Snow White itself was never a Disney invention but rather an adaptation of the timeless tale by the Brothers Grimm. Stories evolve, just as they always have, finding new ways to resonate with different generations. Dismissing reinterpretations simply because they dare to reimagine a beloved story is shortsighted and ignores the very nature of storytelling.

At its core, this film is not a replacement but a heartfelt homage-a love letter to the classic that respects its origins while breathing fresh life into it. It reminds us that the beauty of stories lies not just in preserving them but in allowing them to grow, ensuring they continue to inspire for years to come.",10/10
"From start to finish the best live action remake of any Disney movie!

My wife is a big snow white fan, her favourite movie growing up. She loved it. Every little change was a breath of fresh air. The songs were all well done.

The kids loved it, with all the characters along with the 7 dwarfs, the kids founds so much joy in watching all of them come to life. They laughed, they cried and at times got a bit scared. It was everything you hope for in a Disney movie.

To see all emotions coming out from watching a Disnsy movie, what more could you ask for.

This is a great family movie, and we all loved it.",10/10
"I really don't know why people are hating the movie.

Disney's Snow White is a visually stunning reimagination of the beloved classic, bringing magic and heart to a new generation. Rachel Zegler shines in the titular role, delivering a performance filled with warmth, charm, and depth. Her expressive acting brings Snow White to life, capturing both her innocence and inner strength. Zegler's breathtaking vocals elevate every musical moment, effortlessly blending nostalgia with fresh emotion. Her rendition of classic songs is pure and enchanting, making her the perfect modern-day princess. Snow White movie is a must watch.",10/10
"Took my children to this new rendition of Snow White and as a whole we absolutely loved it. The settings made the movie feel cozy and familiar, but the empowerment of Snow White made the movie refreshing and new! Rachel's voice is insanely beautiful and Gal did her best to keep up with that kind musical talent, and it was okay. Loved every minute and so did my kids! I know people are upset with the Snow White being ""white"" but the movie explains how she got her name. No it's not the same as the original but at the end of the day it's a reimagining of the original. It's okay for there to be deviation from the original. The Harry Potter movies don't follow the books exactly, but it didn't make the movies any less great! I'd encourage you to go watch it for yourself...there are bots that are driving this rating down.",10/10
"I had previously told family and friends I would not go see this movie and I am a huge Disney fan. Then I heard some of the music on the radio and loved it so I decided to go and give it a chance. I told myself to be openminded. Well, I loved it from the very beginning. If you love musicals with very talented singers (no autotune here) this movie can be for you. They had to add more to the story from the original since the original was Walt Disney's first full length animated movie. The original story, although beautiful just wouldn't have enough meat to capture audiences today. I loved this movie. I just hope people will give it a chance and not listen to others.",10/10
"As a fan of the original Snow White and how Disney portrayed Snow in ABC's Once Upon a Time, I love this!!! The songs, the nods to the original film! DOPEY!!! The set details!!! Amazing. I loved every minute. Yes there are things that I wish were still in here but seeing the movie for a second time, I understand why they did what they did. Don't judge this movie based on your difference in opinions with the actors! They all did a phenomenal job regardless of their personal beliefs. This is one I will definitely watch again. This was done better than half of the live action remakes. Not a carbon copy of the original, a new but tasteful version. Easily in my top 5.",10/10
"I thought this movie was pretty good. But nobody wants to give it a chance, I don't know what everyone expected but i thought it was good. The actress that played the queen did a fantastic job and the girl that played Snow White did even better. And dopey he was adorable, I think people need to rewatch it and stop being stuck up about it. There are so much more worse movie out there and this is not one. Yeah they could have done less singing but still good. Again they did a fantastic job making this movie, the ending was very good to so y'all need to get off your high horses and stop being so negative, plus it's Disney do u expect them to be all adult or what? They made it kid friendly I thought, my daughter loved it again great job and wonderful movie.",10/10
"My friends and went the other day and we thought it would be boring, but we had nothing to do and if seemed like something nice we could do. The movie was actually so good. Way more than I expected. People told me it'll be bad, and that it's a waste of money, but I just can't figure out why. I was thinking that maybe it's just me, but my friends also enjoyed it. I think there's something about Snow White which is so childish, but also can be so dark, depends how you try to make it look like, and this movie just brought in them both which made me love it even more. So just do yourself a favour and go watch the movie.",10/10
"I was honestly scared to go see this movie. There has been so much negative talk around it.

I didn't know what to expect, but I thought this movie was amazing.

The original Snow White was a little scary and creepy watching it as a kid, and they definitely kept this feeling in the live action.

They also paid tribute to the original movie many times and it did not disappoint.

My kids, friends and I could not stop laughing. Whether it was intentional or because the movie was truly cringe (in a good way) like all of the Disney cartoon princess movies.. we had a great time watching this movie.

As a true Disney fan of the original Snow White movie, this was a 10 out of 10.

If you haven't seen it, go and watch it. People love to complain and be negative so see for yourself what you think.",10/10
"As a fan of the old Snow White, I was pleasantly surprised with this film. Ignore the people who haven't seen the film review bombing it is an amazing twist on the classic tale. It also has some of the best Disney songs since Encanto and captures the classical Disney magic. My only critique would be the evil queens singing at times is too nasily and her belt could use improvement to sound healthier but all of the character performances were outstanding. The cgi of the dwarves felt weird at first but grew on me as the film progressed and I like the change in the prince character as well as how they both saved each other.",10/10
"I never thought I'd say this-but Snow White has become one of my favorite princesses.

Growing up, the 1937 classic never really spoke to me. Snow White felt passive, distant-more a symbol than a character. Aside from the Once Upon a Time TV show version, she had always been my least favorite princess.

But Disney's 2025 Snow White changed everything.

This reimagining gave us the heroine we always needed: fearless, fair, brave, and true. She's no longer just waiting to be rescued-she leads with heart, makes bold choices, and shines with purpose. I saw myself in her strength, her flaws, her hope. It was powerful.

The film is pure magic. The music? Absolutely sing-along worthy-I've had the soundtrack on loop since I left the theater. It captures the spirit of a fairy tale while feeling completely fresh. The tone reminded me of Enchanted, The Princess Bride, Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Tangled, and Ella Enchanted-clever, heartfelt, and fun, with just the right dose of whimsy.

Without giving anything away, I'll just say the story moved me in ways I didn't expect. I laughed, teared up, and left the theater feeling lighter, like I'd just witnessed something special.

This isn't just a remake. It's a reinvention. And now, Snow White isn't just fair-she's fearless, brave, and true too. I can't wait to watch it again.",10/10

"My daughter and I watched it together, and it was an absolute delight from start to finish.

What truly made this experience special for me was the nostalgia it brought back. It reminded me of my own childhood, watching this classic tale unfold. The music, the characters, and the timeless story of love and friendship resonated deeply with both of us.

The attention to detail and the artistry in the film were remarkable. You can tell that a lot of love and effort went into making this movie. My daughter was captivated by the characters, especially Snow White and the adorable dwarfs. We found ourselves singing along to the songs and sharing laughs throughout.

This movie is not just a film; it's a beautiful journey that bridges generations. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a heartwarming experience to share with their loved ones.",10/10
"Disney's new Snow White has been surrounded by controversy from the start, but now that it's finally here, is it really as bad as some claim? Not at all. While the film isn't a groundbreaking masterpiece, it's far from the disaster some have made it out to be.

Rachel Zegler delivers a solid performance as Snow White, with her acting bringing a fresh, independent take on the classic character. Her singing, as expected, is lovely-her voice is one of the highlights of the movie. While her version of Snow White may not appeal to everyone, she carries the role well.

Visually, the film is a mix of stunning set pieces and some questionable CGI moments, which is a common issue in many modern Disney films. The story has been updated, and while some changes might feel unnecessary, they don't ruin the movie. It still carries the heart of the original tale, just with a more modern sensibility.

Disney and the cast certainly made some missteps but the level of hate this movie has received is completely overblown. If you go in with an open mind, you'll likely find it to be enjoyable.",8/10
"Disney's 2025 live-action reimagining of ""Snow White"" has arrived, and while it attempts to modernize the classic fairy tale, it ultimately stumbles, leaving audiences with a mixed bag of disappointment and fleeting moments of charm. Directed by Marc Webb, the film stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, promising a fresh perspective on the beloved story. However, several missteps prevent it from achieving true ""amazing"" status.

One of the most significant issues lies in the film's script. The dialogue often feels clunky and unnatural, lacking the whimsical charm of the original. Key plot points are altered, but these changes don't necessarily enhance the story, sometimes even detracting from its emotional core. The seven dwarfs, a crucial element of the original, are reimagined with CGI that falls into the uncanny valley, proving more distracting than endearing.

Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is a highlight. She brings a refreshing sincerity and strength to the character, portraying her as more proactive and less passive than in the animated version. Her vocal talents are undeniable, and she delivers the new songs with passion but Disney could have hired another actor who's white as snow because in the animated movie the magic mirror describes snow white's skin as ""white as snow"".

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is another bright spot. She infuses the character with a captivating blend of vanity and menace, making her a compelling antagonist. Her performance hints at the potential the film had, but it's ultimately overshadowed by the weaker aspects of the production.

Visually, ""Snow White"" is a mixed bag. While some scenes capture the fairytale atmosphere, others suffer from cheap-looking CGI and uninspired set design.

The film's attempts to modernize the story also fall flat. While updating certain aspects for contemporary audiences is understandable, ""Snow White"" seems unsure of its target audience, resulting in a film that doesn't fully satisfy either nostalgic fans of the original or those seeking a fresh, modern take.

But overall the film is really good! I didn't like where the seven dwarfs were CGI and they could've replaced them with real actors with dwarfism. But other than that it's honestly quite spectacular.",10/10
"Rachel played such an enchanting princess and her voice is truly magical I was in awe watching her on screen. Snow White has meant a lot to me since I was 11 years old and I am so glad an actress this talented and genuine played the character that will always be so close to my heart. Seeing little girls dressed up as her in the theatre made me tear up.

I really enjoyed the version of the love story they did too and their duet was so beautiful it's been on repeat for days.

The dwarves and Evil Queen did not do it for me however. Their scenes felt quite jarring and out of place in the otherwise well adapted fairytale world. Still rated 10 stars just because I love Snow White so much.",10/10
"Snow White has that pure Disney magic, thanks to some incredible new music and a fantastic lead performance from Rachel Zegler! Waiting on a Wish was worth the price of admission alone! I had a smile on my face the whole time, it made the Disney adult in me very happy and worked very well as an adaptation of the original 1937 animated film. As someone who never really loved the original besides the appreciation of the history and the art behind it, I was way more into this version of the story! Not only that but unlike some other Disney live-action adaptations, this was a true adaptation of the story rather than pure nostalgic mimicry like The Lion King was! I liked the moments and songs that they kept, and I liked the changes they made! While not every choice in the movie works, director Marc Webb did a solid job bringing this fairytale to life with only a few missteps here and there. It can be clunky, and moments didn't always feel earned by the film especially when it came to emotion, but it still had that magical Disney feel to it. And it boasts some of the best new Disney music in years! Waiting on a Wish is spectacular, Good Things Grow is a perfect opening, Princess Problems is so fun, and A Hand Meets a Hand is gorgeous. The extensions/reworking of some of the classic songs like Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work were fantastic too and I was so happy to see those sequences come to life - it made me feel the same way I do when I go to Disneyland! The music was my favourite part for sure - songwriters Pasek and Paul did a fantastic job here! Another pro: Rachel Zegler was born to play a Disney princess! She is a naturally gifted performer, and she enchants as Snow White with her stunning singing voice and inherent charm. She is a star and one of the best parts and main reasons to see the film! Gal Gadot, on the other hand, is horribly miscast and one of the worst parts of the film, delivering a performance full of horrid line readings. I've come to expect little from these Disney remakes, but Snow White ended up being genuinely great! It's flawed, but it's one of the better remakes and I loved the changes they made while honouring what we love about the original - it is worth a watch for Disney fans! It's a magical delight - I was so surprised at how much I liked it! Much better than people are making it out to be!",8/10

"It was so amazing I loved it so much! Rachel's one of the best actresses of this generation and I loved seeing her as Snow White. I loved the relationship between her and Jonathan and the dwarves, especially Dopey, were adorable. I think this Snow White will be an inspiration to little girls everywhere. Definitely going to rewatch because it was just awesome and I can't wait to see what details I missed on the first watch. Special shoutout to young Snow because she was absolutely adorable and perfect for the role! I do think the Evil Queen could've been scarier though. Either way, 10/10 Recommend this movie to anyone!",10/10
"I think that this is such a fun movie! The sets and cinematography were so beautiful! I think that Disney made a wonderful remake that captures the essence of a fairytale!

The original songs were wonderfully done and the costumes were fun! Its nice to see such colorful costumes that make it feel so fantastical!

The actors did a fantastic job and the singing was amazing! Rachel Zeggler did so well and has such a gorgeous voice, and Gal Gadot did an amazing job as well! I think that overall the movie is a fun time and will make you laugh!

I really think that casting was done well and had some fun added characters. With the message of being kind, even when others aren't and doing whats right even when you are scared this is a great movie for everyone!",10/10
"A truly spectacular and beautiful version of SnowWhite! The concept, the story, the costume design, the music and everything was a true pleasure for the viewer! It shows what beauty is- to share and to be thankful for what you are and what you have whatever that is. And on the other hand the contrast is enviousness, selfishness, egoism and the worst desire of all- to be more than the others, to be above them and to want the others to worship you. This desire is shown in its actual colors - at the end it's always most destructive for the ones who have it. A beautiful movie- I can't wait to watch it again!",10/10
"Magnificent, fairytale-like, mesmerizing, and healing for the inner child.

This reinterpretation delivers an even more impactful message. I believe both children and adults who watch it will gain valuable insights-learning to be gentle without being weak, strong without being hardened, and courageous while holding onto hope. Even just the stunning visuals make it worth watching, but beyond that, you also get to experience Rachel's incredible performance and enjoy beautiful music throughout. It's truly captivating, never dull for a moment. An outstanding viewing experience-I highly recommend it to anyone still on the fence. Even my boyfriend love it.",10/10
I saw it and felt heartwarmed by Rachel Zegler's potrayal and singing. I can tell she put in her heart and soul into this movie. There people who are being unreasonable. Snow White deserve love and respect. This movie will always have a place in my heart for every movie I watch. Rachel proves that she is a very beautiful and magical heartwarming Live Action Snow White. Rachel and Gal performances will not be forgotten by me and others like me. And Waiting On A Wish is song that feels and sounds like another Disney masterpiece. If you don't like this movie then your being unreasonable. Rachel and the other Live action princesses could make a cross over.,10/10
"Go and watch this film! Ignore the online hate. The songs are amazing. Gal Gadot is as she is in all her films... lacking acting, but Rachel Zegler is INCREDIBLE.

The story is fast paced and gripping. It's funny, emotional, heartwarming and an amazing nod to the film that started it all.

As someone who has never loved the original Snow White film, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this, but this film proved me wrong. I can't wait to watch it again.

Please please please ignore the hate online and go and watch it for yourself. I'm so glad I didn't listen to the critics. If you love Disney, you'll love this.",10/10
"I went into Snow White 2025 with an open mind, and I'm so happy I did. New Snow White isn't trying to be a carbon copy of original. It's a modern retelling that brings new life to the story while still keeping it heart. Zegler delivers a strong heartfelt performance as a Snow White. She brings warmth & charm to the rile, making her feel like a real person rather than just a passive princess. The Visuals are gorgeous, the costumes are stunning.

It's disappointing to see so much unnecessary negativity around this movie. If you actually watch it for what it is. Not for what people on the internet claim. It's a beautifully made movie with a lot of heart.

If you also loves fairytales, Give Snow White a Chance. It just might surprise you!.",10/10
"I viewed Snow White this weekend and found it wonderful. The theatre was full of kids who all seemed to enjoy it.

The music was fantastic - especially ""Waiting on a Wish"" and ""Princess Problems"". I didn't miss ""Someday My Prince WIll Come"" - maybe because that is an outdated notion that a princess has to wait for a prince.

Rachel Ziegler was a perfect choice to play Snow White. Her voice was excellent and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Snow White once I saw her performance.

Snow White's character was something to admire. Holding onto her Father's ideals was something to be applauded - not rejected because it wasn't the same as the 1937 version.

There still was an evil queen (Gal Godot - fantastic) who was defeated - not by 1 person but by the community. Again - a great lesson to be learned.

The animation/CGI of forest animals and 7 Dwarfs was in the great Disney tradition and was done well. Grumpy is still my favorite.

Fantastic all around!",10/10

"Even though I had many prejudices, I loved the movie. One of the most beautiful live action. I don't understand so much hate, the show is fun and exciting. There are some differences with the original classic, that I love, but I still found it fresh and enjoyable. The scene in the cave is amazing.the musical show worthy of Broadway.

I saw the film with the group of differently abled kids I work with and they loved it, their attention span never dropped. A film that hits them in the heart.

I understand that there may be controversy over the changes made based on the original film, which may or may not be liked, but in my opinion this film does not deserve a panning of this kind.",10/10

"Disney's Snow White (2025) is a breathtaking triumph that reimagines the classic tale with vibrant energy and heart. Rachel Zegler's captivating performance as Snow White is nothing short of magical, her voice and presence lighting up the screen, while Andrew Burnap's charming Jonathan adds a fresh twist to the story. The acting across the board is stellar, blending nostalgia with modern flair, and the stunning visuals and enchanting songs swept me away. Watching it, I felt like a little boy again, wide-eyed and lost in the wonder of a fairy tale brought to life with such brilliance.

Wow, what a movie.",10/10
"As a Disney kid that grew up loving the brand! I was intrigued by all the press and decided to go in with a complete neutral mindset to give it a shot Disney always has a way to make ""Magic"" happen.

Boy oh boy a movie that once saved The Disney corporation has somehow managed to discredit all the principles I used to believe it once stood for the this ""fairytale"" was made for one person and one person only and thats As a Disney kid that grew up loving the brand! I was intrigued by all the press and decided to go in with a complete neutral mindset to give it a shot Disney always has a way to make ""Magic"" happen.

Boy oh boy a movie that once saved The Disney corporation has somehow managed to discredit all the principles I used to believe it once stood for the this ""fairytale"" was made for one person and one person only and that's the lead actress. Her uninspired performance gave a character who is supposed to be joyful an almost bitter, angry and selfish feel to the whole movie.

I understand production companies refuse to bring out new ideas and only want to push movies with an ""ip"" but there is a line where the remakes shouldn't seem like an attack on everything that is wrong with the original. Walt Disney would be rolling over in his grave over this disaster of a movie.",-/10

"How does Disney manage to set the bar lower than the ground? You walk in with expectations six feet under and they still manage to limbo under them. Rachel Zegler is grating and looks like Lord Farquad, Gal Gadot can't act to save her life, and the CGI looks unfinished. The plot is there, but they butchered the source material beyond recognition. It is not just bad, it is hollow, lazy, and painfully out of touch. Just when you think they have hit bottom, they grab a shovel and keep digging.

Honestly, this type of failure needs to be admired for it's sheer stupidity. There's an entire fanbase screaming at Disney for what they want so they can throw billions of dollars at them, and they're like ""naw, we're good"".",1/10
"Snow White is a frustrating and uninspired remake that completely misses the magic of the original. Instead of embracing the timeless charm of the fairytale, it tries too hard to modernize the story, resulting in forced dialogue, weak character development, and an overall lack of heart. The lead performance feels flat, failing to bring warmth or depth to Snow White, while the supporting cast adds little to the experience. Even the visuals are inconsistent-some moments look impressive, but others feel oddly cheap and artificial. The film's pacing drags, making it difficult to stay engaged, and the emotional moments fall flat due to the lack of genuine character connections. Ultimately, Snow White is a soulless retelling that strips away the wonder and whimsy that made the original so beloved. It feels more like a corporate product than a passion-driven film, making it hard to recommend, even for longtime fans of the story.",1/10
"Almost 20 years of watching movies an tv shows and i never watch something bad like this one.

The rest from friend....

Disney's latest live-action adaptation of ""Snow White"" is a disappointing attempt to modernize a classic The film's overuse of CGl results in a lifeless, artificial aesthetic that lacks the charm of the original animation.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is notably underwhelming, failing to convey the menace and depth the character demands.

While Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White brings some vitality, it isn't enough to salvage the film from its uninspired narrative choices and lackluster execution.

Overall, this remake feels unnecessary and fails to capture the magic that made the original a beloved masterpiece.",1/10
I always try to be positive when it comes to the animated Disney movies.. but no .. goodness no .. Gal Gadot had the most annoying accent to start with and it's been the case with all her movies .. Rachel Zegler was better than my expectations and I think she could do better with better cast. Please stop making these live action reimaging movies .. Aladdin was the only movie that succeeded that I watched couple of times.. but this one was a waste of money and time ..there were many dull moments that the movie can go without it.. I still can't get over the weak accent of Gal Gadot.. maybe if Angelina Jolie was part of would be better .. but still many dull moments ..,1/10
"It's just a total mess. From start to finish, this movie is a disaster in every sense of the word. The plot? Barely there. The acting? Forced and emotionless. The CGI? Looks like it was done on a free app. I don't even know what they were trying to do with this remake, but whatever it was - it failed.

The only good thing in this entire film is Gal Gadot. Every time she's on screen, you hope she wins - not because she's the villain, but because this fake Snow White from AliExpress is unbearable to watch.

Save your time, your expectations, and most importantly - your mental health.

Avoid at all costs.",1/10
"The Evil Witch wasn't very good at acting. It felt like she spent the entire movie trying to hurt innocent young women and children. I really didn't like that she felt so entitled to just hurt and injure as many women and children as she could. You would think hurting the innocent is against forest law but she didn't care to listen. She kept doing it and thankfully - finally - someone stopped her because it was the right thing to do.

Besides the actress they casted, there were some other issues with the animation. I did not enjoy it. I would probably just stick with watching the original version for this one.",1/10
"Fighting for my life to stay awake in that theater, The dream I had in my seat was better then this wreck of a movie. The plot was outrageous and the dwarfs pissed me off to look at they look my thumbs with CGI, her costume is horrible along with the wig nothing gave the off the original vibe her dress in the 1937 one and the whole outfit of the evil queen looked cheap. 209 million dollars to waste, everything felt cheap are they only thing that could make up for it was the visuals and lighting. The songs go through your ears and out they feel very forgettable they sing the same song two time. If you want a good April fools movie watch this..",1/10
"I had low expectations, but somehow, this movie still managed to disappoint me beyond belief. Disney has officially lost the magic. The new Snow White is a complete disaster-uninspired, poorly written, and lacking any charm from the original.

First off, the story barely resembles Snow White. It feels like they stripped away everything that made the classic beloved and replaced it with bland, soulless writing. The characters are dull, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the CGI looks cheap. Even the dwarfs (or whatever they are now) feel like an afterthought.

The worst part? Snow White herself. There's no charisma, no warmth-just a generic, modernized take that removes everything iconic about her character. The Evil Queen is the only one trying, but even she can't save this train wreck.

Overall, this remake proves that some classics should be left alone. Disney, please stop butchering your own legacy.",1/10
By far one of the worst movies I've ever watched. I contemplated leaving the theater and start doing homework that's due for next week. Not only should this movie be reviewed in classes of what went wrong but it should also pay people back for suffering throughout the whole movie. In all seriousness this was actually so bad I felt bad for the girl I brought on the first date. Safe to say Snow White ruined my chances of getting a second. I hate almost everything about this movie other then the fact that the seven dwarfs were in it but all the acting was terrible i genuinely pray for those who starred in the movie and read the reviews.,1/10
"I don't even know where to begin with this absolute trainwreck of a movie. ""Snow White"" is the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry-except the paint is more interesting. How this film is considered a ""classic"" is beyond me because it's a tedious, lifeless mess that drags on for what feels like an eternity.

First off, Snow White herself is one of the most annoying, helpless protagonists in film history. She spends the entire movie either cleaning, singing to birds, or waiting for a prince to come save her. She has the personality of a damp sponge and the voice of a helium-filled chipmunk. If I had to listen to her sing one more time, I would have gladly eaten that poisoned apple myself.

The Seven Dwarfs? More like the Seven Gimmicks. Their only purpose is to be goofy caricatures with one-dimensional personalities. Dopey, in particular, is painfully unfunny, and Grumpy-ironically-is the only one I could relate to while suffering through this film.

In short, Snow White is an overrated, outdated slog that doesn't deserve its status as a classic. If you have insomnia, this might be the cure. Otherwise, save yourself the pain and watch literally anything else.",1/10
"I went to the cinema with my daughter, hoping for a magical afternoon. After 30 minutes, she rolled her eyes in annoyance. I envy her, because I couldn't close mine fast enough. The film is a sung insult-and I dislike it when people sing in films. But I thought, *maybe the kid will like it*. Yeah, nope. It didn't. Instead of magic, there were artificial sets from digital hell, wooden leading ladies, and a story that you can only mess up if you really *try* to. The original story would have been enough to set the stage-but no, they had to ""reinterpret"" it, of course. The result was a film with as much charm as a wet washcloth. I recommend to everyone: believe the hype-the negative hype, that is. And rightly so. 1 out of 10 stars. And that's only because 0 is not an option.",1/10
"This used to be one core memory of my childhood that I'll never forget ONLY for it to be made with no zeal, no enthusiasm, wrong choice of actors, even my kids considered it as boring and I felt their pain

It made me and my family cringe so hard, it's so sad to know that Disney might loose a lot from this mess

Where is the drive,

Where is the love for acting,

Where is the love for story telling, and don't even get me started on the rewritten story line 💀

Wasn't she supposed to fall in love ? Even if tweaks should be made why was the main goal tarnished ?

These actors shouldn't act anymore!

Do well next time Disney!",1/10
"What the heck did I just watch. I don't follow the talking heads on any platform so when my daughter asked me to take her and a friend I was excited by their enthusiasm. Suffice it to say that we didn't leave with the joy we have had watching Classic Disney films. My daughter was gravely disappointed. I was as well.

This was such an extreme departure from the classic storyline that they may as well have named it something else, with a tagline like "" Snow White like you've never seen her before ""

Quite honestly Snow White and the Huntsman was a far better spin on the original concept. I can't believe I just said that, but it's absolutely true.

Hard pass if you love classic Disney.",1/10
"I'd rather have colonic irrigation than watch this again. The cast is simply horrible, the props tired. That's an already boring story, it would need talent to lift it but that was nowhere to be seen. My kids mean that I had to watch it but really, no one should have to bear that. Awful. It's very important that you keep your kids safe by not exposing them to such poppycock. If one was to add Gad's performance on top of it all then they'd get into grotesque territory. Do yourselves a favour, avoid like the plague. By the way, the costumes are fab, one shouldn't be negative about everything just because of Gad.",2/10
"Honestly, I've only ever asked for my money back once before and that was about 20 minutes into Bruno.

They didn't give it, but they should have. Not sure what Disney was thinking with this remake but all I can say is unnecessary.

I'm sure nobody asked for it, we went to see it solely for nostalgic reasons and honesty shame on us for that. Should have known it was going to be another completely soulless cash grab by Disney.

Disney, if your paying attention, stick to the animation.

Gal Gadot was amazing, but your sickening blend of cgi and real life for snow white is literally nauseating. Like watching a wax museum starlet melt in front of you. The dwarves were comical, but not true to there personas.

Huge huge disappointment and you've lost the trust of your consumer base for certain.",1/10
"As a child, Snow White was my go-to Disney movie, but now at 23, I wish I never saw it. The 2025 remake is an abomination, draining the magic out of it. The CGI dwarves are stiff, the story a muddled mess, and Snow White herself is not endearing. The awkward ""modern"" twists to the classic story ruin the original and render it dull and unidentifiable. Even the songs are forgettable. It was almost a betrayal to my childhood seeing this lifeless remake. Instead of nostalgia, I was left disappointed, and it just goes to show not every classic movie needs to be remade.overall I wish Disney make up for that.",1/10
"Even though I hated the cast, especially Rachel, I tried to watch the movie because I really love the classic Snow White story. I think this movie was a bit forced. Mismatched casts, weird CGI, and inconsistencies with the original story. I feel this movie did not live up to the expectations of the audience and Disney lovers.

I couldn't even stand to watch it until the end because the story was boring. When I realized this was a waste of budget , says nothing.

Note to Disney : Choose actors whose appearance matches the original story. Our imaginations are at play here. Sorry, Disney, disappointing.",1/10
"The only good thing about this movie was casting Rachel as Snow White. Gal Gadot was a horrible choice, not only is she a terrorist, but she's also one of the worst actresses to walk the face of the planet. Casting her completely ruined any chance of this movie being somewhat decent. If her acting skills were as good as her victim playing skills, she would be an incredible actress. Unfortunately for her, she's horrible at acting. I honestly feel somewhat guilty saying all this about the movie, ONLY because the main actress is Rachel Zegler. But complete honestly, this is a horrible movie for one reason, and one only, Gal Gadot.",1/10
"Wow. That was bad. If it's an entirely different movie, title it something different. Even with that said, not a good flick. I can't believe Disney would let this get through editing. Doomed from the start. Stick to original story lines. If creating something new from an original, new title and don't disrespect the original with the new. The amount of bad publicity for this movie did not sway me from seeing it. I went in with a reasonably objectionable attitude. The story did not capture me as I was waiting for the original story to unfold. When it was apparent the movie was not a live action version of the original, they didn't have me committed to the new storyline for Mae to buy in to this new movie.",1/10

"To understand the major issues with this remake, we must first understand what the meaning behind the story of Snow White is.

Snow White is a story about beauty and vanity. It is an assessment of the human condition and how obsession with appearances can lead to your demise.

The Queen is the ""fairest"" of them all not because she is a just ruler, but because she is enchantingly beautiful. When the Mirror declares that Snow White is now the fairest, it is not implying that Snow White is a ""just"" princess, but is more fair-skinned, beautiful and radiant than the Queen is.

The Queen takes a potion to turn into the Old Hag, which is irreversible, and she remains this way until her demise on the cliff. She would rather die the Old Hag and sacrifice her beauty (the one thing she truly desires) to trick Snow White, than let Snow White have it.

With this understanding and aim, the remake sharply contrasts the original story as a hollow shell of some set of tropes that no longer bear any meaning. The remake has the Old Hag, Mirror, poisoned apple, and even the dwarves, but none of these things resemble the what they symbolized in the actual story, rendering them pointless and devoid of any consequence.

Here are some examples:

In the remake, Snow White is very independent right from the moment she enters their home. She quickly becomes their ""leader"" and so there really is no point of including the dwarves at all as they contribute nothing to her development. Even at the end when they sneak into the castle for the final fight, they serve literally no purpose.

The Queen transforms into the Old Hag but then can revert to her beautiful old self whenever she pleases. What is the point of the sacrifice if she can just undo it at will? Where is the commentary on human nature where she would rather destroy herself than let the other have all the beauty and glory? The poisoned apple and transformation no longer matter because the Queen can just change anything at any time.

And here is the worst part: at the start of the film, the Mirror declares the Evil Queen is the ""fairest of them all"" and explicitly judges her based on her beauty. She is by no means a just ruler. In fact, when the Queen is first introduced she is set up as ""enchantingly beautiful"" physically.

However, after Snow White frees a rebel, the Mirror declares her to be the fairest, not in a sense of beauty like the original story, but in some socio-political means. This is now a huge shift in the story that is not only reconciled later but gets even more inconsistent.

After Snow White is poisoned and falls asleep, the Mirror once again declares the Queen is the fairest. But which is it? The Mirror claims to judge based on truth, but flip flops between superficial beauty (in the case of the Queen) and deeper justice (in the case of Snow White. Which is it? It cannot be both; the whole point of the story is that a Mirror only judges someone by their appearance. If the Queen is concerned only with beauty, then why does she care if the Mirror is claiming Snow White is the fairest, the most just dep down inside?

The movie ends with the Mirror claiming beauty lies beyond the skin, and yet the Mirror kept switching its definition of ""fairness"" throughout the movie. The definitions are subjective, and it really makes no sense.

Even if we put aside that the story has been blasted apart into a confused jumble of empty tropes (for the sake of nostalgia?) the writing and music is terrible and incredibly forgettable. The sound mixing was off, the voices flat and dull, and most of the dialogue was incredibly forced and boring.

Gal Gadot is simply not a good actress either.

Everything about this movie stinks, and it is a shame that our children will grow up with such terrible takes on classic, culture-defining stories.",1/10

There was so much of this movie that I did not like I can easily say this is the worse movie I have ever seen do not waste your time.why is the movie called Snow White if it has nothing to do with Snow White just a disappointment I was so excited for this movie only for it to come out like this. Disney is a joke at this point there live action movies have been bad but this one tops them all. Someone need to take over there studio bc this is just Embarrassing for them. The casting its self is horrible they used cgi instead of finding actors which is lazy even for Disney. Snow white did not love like Snow White but I'm not even bothered by that it's the fact that she doesn't understand the story of now white and prefers to make a whole other story then it's just like what is even the point of it she did not do a good job acting not even the story that she supposedly made to make Snow White better.,1/10
"Waste of my precious time.

Absolutely disappointing! The new Snow White movie completely missed the mark. The plot was weak, the characters lacked depth, and the pacing was all over the place. Snow White herself was flat and uninteresting, and the magic of the original was completely lost. The CGI was overdone, and the songs were forgettable. It felt like a rushed cash grab with no heart or charm. If you're a fan of the classic, this will leave you frustrated and underwhelmed. A major letdown.

"Disney's live-action Snow White serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of relying too heavily on nostalgia without offering fresh perspectives. Its failure to innovate, coupled with technical missteps and lackluster performances, results in a film that neither honors its predecessor nor stands confidently on its own. For audiences seeking the magic and wonder of the original, this remake regrettably fails to deliver. Commercially, Snow White has underperformed, reflecting its critical reception. The film's opening weekend grossed a mere $87 million globally, a figure that pales in comparison to its substantial production budget. This financial shortfall underscores the disconnect between the studio's expectations and audience interest.",1/10
"There are bad movies, and then there's this-a film so insufferably awful that it transcends mere incompetence and becomes an endurance test for anyone unfortunate enough to sit through it. Calling this a movie feels generous. It's more like a cruel social experiment to see how long an audience can tolerate excruciating boredom, mind-numbing stupidity, and an utter lack of artistic merit before they walk out, screaming for their money back.

Let's start with the plot-or rather, the complete absence of one. The script is a disaster of epic proportions, seemingly cobbled together from rejected high school creative writing assignments. It lacks coherence, structure, or any semblance of narrative momentum. Characters stumble aimlessly through scene after scene with no clear motivation, engaging in dialogue so vapid and cringe-inducing that you'd swear it was AI-generated by a malfunctioning chatbot. Nothing happens for long stretches, and when something finally does happen, it's either idiotic beyond belief or so predictable that it might as well have been telegraphed in neon lights.

The dialogue is an abomination. Every line feels like it was written by someone who has never heard human beings speak. The characters trade lifeless, robotic exchanges filled with clichés, awkward exposition, and failed attempts at humor that land with the grace of a brick through a windshield. It's as if the screenwriter actively despised the audience and wanted to punish them with each groan-worthy line.

The performances are somehow even worse. It's almost impressive how every actor in the film manages to deliver their lines with the same dead-eyed, soul-draining monotony. Whether they are supposed to be experiencing joy, sorrow, or terror, their expressions remain frozen in a permanent state of confused indifference. The lead actor, in particular, gives a performance so staggeringly wooden that it makes mannequins look expressive. Meanwhile, the supporting cast, seemingly aware that they are trapped in an irredeemable train wreck, either overact with cartoonish exaggeration or simply give up and mumble their way through their scenes.

Visually, the film is a dumpster fire. The cinematography is an eyesore, featuring inexplicable framing choices, bizarre camera angles, and lighting that either drowns everything in ugly, washed-out brightness or cloaks scenes in murky darkness. The editing is so incompetent that it feels like the work of someone using video software for the first time. Shots linger awkwardly, cuts come at the worst possible moments, and entire sequences seem to be stitched together with all the finesse of a child gluing together a shredded homework assignment.

The special effects? Laughable. The CGI looks like it was pulled from an early-2000s PlayStation 2 cutscene, while practical effects, when used, appear so embarrassingly cheap that they evoke the production values of a high school play. The sound design is equally atrocious, with music that is either completely mismatched to the tone of the scene or so generic that it could be royalty-free stock audio. Sound effects are jarring and misplaced, with gunshots that sound like firecrackers and explosions that seem to have been created using a toaster microphone.

And let's not forget the pacing-or lack thereof. The film drags on for an eternity, stuffing every agonizing minute with filler that serves no purpose. Scenes stretch far beyond their welcome, filled with pointless conversations, redundant flashbacks, and meaningless subplots that lead nowhere. It's as if the director mistakenly thought that longer meant better, completely unaware that the audience is suffering through every agonizing second.

By the time the film reaches its insultingly lazy, rushed, and unsatisfying conclusion, any lingering hope of redemption is crushed. There is no payoff, no catharsis, nothing of value to take away from the experience. The only thing left is an overwhelming sense of regret for having wasted time on something so irredeemably bad.

In short, this movie is a complete and utter failure in every conceivable way. It fails as entertainment, as storytelling, and as filmmaking in general. It is not just bad-it is an assault on cinema itself.",1/10
"The movie misses the mark by a wide margin. The plot seems rushed and uninspired, lacking the magic and charm of the original. The characters are flat, and the dialogue is riddled with clichés. Special effects appear outdated, and the soundtrack fails to enhance the mood or emotion of the scenes. Overall, it feels more like a cash-grab than a careful reimagining. Save your time and skip this one. Snow White 2025 utterly disappoints in its attempt to revamp the classic tale. The storyline is both predictable and uninspiring, failing to capture any essence of magic or wonder. Characters are poorly developed, with performances that feel disengaged and lifeless. The visual effects, instead of adding awe, appear cheap and outdated. Additionally, the music doesn't resonate with the film's themes, leaving moments feeling hollow. It comes across more as a lackluster cash grab than a creative re-envisioning. Sadly, it's a tedious watch from start to finish.",1/10
"If I could give this movie zero stars, I absolutely would. It was one of the most boring films I have ever watched, with a weak storyline, uninspired performances, and a complete lack of engaging moments.

I kept waiting for something exciting or meaningful to happen, but it never did. The cinematography and direction were equally lackluster, adding to the overall disappointment.

"Disney's Snow White 2025 is a baffling misfire that strips the classic tale of its charm, replacing it with lifeless CGI and hollow messaging. Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks presence, the Prince is barely relevant, and the so called bandits are uninspired replacements for the original dwarves. Worse, the CGI dwarves look nightmarish, stuck deep in the uncanny valley, making every scene with them unsettling. The film tries to modernize the story but feels soulless and confused. The visuals are bland, the music is forgettable, and the magic is completely gone. It is a dull and joyless attempt to fix what was never broken.",1/10
"Disney's live-action Snow White (2025) is not just bad-it's a complete disaster. From the moment the first scene rolls, it's clear that this remake is an uninspired, soulless attempt to modernize a classic that didn't need fixing.

The biggest issue? The story. Instead of honoring the beloved original, Disney decided to throw in unnecessary changes that feel forced and out of place. The seven dwarfs, a crucial part of the original charm, are now CGI creations that look awkward and lifeless. And let's not forget the baffling decision to replace the Prince with a new character named Jonathan, who adds absolutely nothing to the plot.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the grace and warmth of the animated classic, and while her singing is fine, her performance is bland. Meanwhile, Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is disappointingly one-note, lacking the chilling presence that made the animated version so iconic.

Visually, the movie is another letdown. The CGI is overdone, making everything look artificial and lifeless rather than magical. Even the costume design feels cheap compared to previous Disney live-action films.

Overall, Snow White (2025) is a perfect example of why not every classic needs a remake. It strips away the magic, replaces it with uninspired changes, and ultimately turns a beloved fairytale into a forgettable mess. If you're looking for nostalgia or a worthy reimagining, this isn't it.

⭐ 0.5 - A waste of time.",1/10
"I've got to say, this isn't merely a case of my expectations not being met-it's a complete letdown from start to finish. I'm forced to give Snow White a 1/10 rating because every element of the film seems to have been carelessly thrown together without any respect for what made the original story enchanting. The pacing is uneven, the character development is seriously lacking, and the visuals, which should have been a feast, end up being nothing more than a disappointing mismatch of tired ideas and bland execution. Even the humor feels as though it were inserted as an afterthought, failing miserably to spark any genuine amusement. As someone who has cherished fairy tales since childhood, watching this film feels like a betrayal to the legacy of the story. In short, well, the other reviews speak for themselves-every critic who has taken the time to evaluate it in detail comes away with the same grim conclusion. The film does nothing to revive the magic of its source material and instead falls into the trap of being a subpar, forgettable experience that leaves its audience both frustrated and disillusioned.",1/10
"This movie is a mess and pathetic in very way of film making. Don't waste your money and time. Instead watch original animated movie.

That's looks so cringe and annoying. Such a torture movie 😭 acting performance are horrible , even Gal's performance is very bad i never watch her performed that bad before. Clearly lack of talent and intrest shown in their performances. CGI is horrible except for some scenes. Story is a complete message with no clear vision and direction.",1/10
"I went to see Snow White determined to like it, despite all that I had read. Rachel Zegler has a nice singing voice, as evidenced by her work in West Side Story. She's limited as an actress, but I thought she'd be adequate in Snow White. Wrong!!! Her singing is fine, but she's awkwardly amateurish in her acting. Gal Gadot was glamorous as the Evil Queen, but she's also stiff as an actress. But the really bad part of the movie was the creepy CGI dwarfs. They were not only creepy but primitively rendered. As for the ""modernizing"" changes to the original story, I can't believe how much worse it was than had been predicted. I really think this movie was one of the worst that I've ever seen.",1/10
"I went in expecting a classic Disney story, something that would bring back the magic I loved as a child. Instead, I got a lifeless performance, horrible acting, and a film that seemed to lack care in even the smallest details. At first, I thought I was alone in feeling this way-but clearly, I wasn't.

Rachel Zegler, in a role that many actresses would have given anything to play, delivers a shockingly dull and uninspired performance as Snow White. While she has a strong singing voice, that's where the praise ends. Her acting is flat, completely missing the warmth and charm that made the animated character so iconic. Her line delivery feels robotic, her emotions forced, and she never manages to bring any real depth to the role. Instead of capturing Snow White's innocence and kindness, she comes across as detached, uninterested, and, at times, completely disconnected from the character.

What a complete waste of time.",1/10
"Everything about this movie felt completely off when compared to the original source material. From the moment it started, it was clear that the creators took far too many creative liberties, straying so far from what made the original great. The characters felt unrecognizable, the storyline was poorly executed, and the pacing was a complete mess. It was frustrating to watch as the film dragged on, failing to capture the essence of what fans loved in the first place. Every scene felt like a disappointment, making it harder and harder to stay engaged. By the time it was over, I couldn't help but feel like I had completely wasted my time. It was honestly unbearable, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you value your patience and sanity, do yourself a favor and skip this disaster. This is my honest opinion, and I stand by it-this movie is nothing more than a waste of time.",1/10
"Disney's latest live-action adaptation, Snow White, proves that not all classic stories need modern reinvention-especially when the essence of the original is lost in the process. From weak writing to uninspired performances, this film falls short of the magic that made the 1937 animated masterpiece a beloved classic.

One of the most glaring issues is Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White. While she has undeniable vocal talent, her performance lacks the charm and warmth that made the original character so endearing. Instead of embodying Snow White's innocence and kindness, Zegler's take on the character feels detached, lacking the emotional depth needed to carry the film. Whether due to the script or her own approach, she struggles to make the role feel genuine, leaving audiences without a protagonist to truly root for.

Beyond the casting, the film suffers from a misguided attempt to modernize the story. While updating classic fairy tales can be refreshing, Snow White strips away much of what made the original compelling, replacing it with a forced narrative that feels more like a generic fantasy adventure than a timeless fairy tale. The lack of the iconic dwarfs as we know them, coupled with uninspired CGI and lackluster world-building, only adds to the film's identity crisis.

Visually, the movie is inconsistent. While some scenes showcase impressive production design, others are weighed down by overuse of CGI that lacks the polish expected from a high-budget Disney film. The musical numbers, though competently performed, lack the staying power of the original's unforgettable songs.

Ultimately, Snow White feels like a missed opportunity. Rather than honoring the legacy of the first Disney animated feature, it tries too hard to be something it's not, alienating fans of the original while failing to captivate a new audience. Disney has had success with live-action remakes in the past, but this one is unlikely to join the ranks of Cinderella or The Jungle Book.",1/10
"The new Snow White film has sparked quite a bit of conversation, but unfortunately, my experience with it was far from positive. As a long-time fan of the classic fairy tale, I had high hopes for this adaptation, expecting a fresh take on a beloved story. However, I was left disappointed by the overall execution, particularly the performances and the direction.

First and foremost, the casting of the lead character, Snow White, was a major letdown. The actress chosen for the role failed to bring the charm and depth that the character demands. Instead of embodying the innocence and resilience that define Snow White, her performance felt flat and uninspired. Throughout the film, I found myself struggling to connect with her character. The emotional range was lacking, and key moments that should have evoked sympathy or excitement fell completely flat. It seemed as though she was merely going through the motions rather than genuinely inhabiting the role.

Moreover, the supporting cast did little to elevate the film. Characters that should have been vibrant and engaging were reduced to one-dimensional caricatures. The dwarfs, who play an essential role in the story, were particularly disappointing. Instead of being portrayed as unique individuals with distinct personalities, they felt like generic sidekicks, lacking the wit and charm that made them memorable in previous adaptations. The chemistry between the characters was almost nonexistent, making it difficult to invest in their relationships or care about their fates.

The script also left much to be desired. The dialogue was often cringe-worthy, with lines that felt forced and unnatural. It seemed as though the writers were trying too hard to update the story for a modern audience, but the attempts at humor and relevance fell flat. There were moments that should have been poignant or magical, but instead, they came across as awkward and contrived. The pacing of the film was uneven, leading to a disjointed narrative that failed to maintain engagement. At times, I found myself checking the time, eager for the film to reach its conclusion.

Visually, while the film had its moments of beauty, the overall aesthetic felt inconsistent. The cinematography lacked the enchanting quality that one would expect from a fairy tale. Some scenes were visually stunning, showcasing lush landscapes and vibrant colors, but others felt dull and uninspired. The special effects, which should have added to the magic of the story, often appeared cheap and unconvincing. Instead of immersing the audience in a fantastical world, it felt more like a low-budget production that failed to deliver on its promises.

Additionally, the direction of the film was questionable at best. The pacing was erratic, with some scenes dragging on while others felt rushed. It was as if the director was unsure of how to balance the various elements of the story, leading to a final product that felt disjointed and lacking cohesion. Key moments that should have been climactic were underwhelming, leaving the audience with a sense of dissatisfaction rather than fulfillment.

In conclusion, the new Snow White film failed to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. With a lackluster performance from the lead actress, a weak script, and inconsistent direction, it struggled to capture the magic and charm of the original tale. As a viewer, I left the theater feeling disappointed and unfulfilled, wishing for a film that could do justice to the beloved character of Snow White. Unfortunately, this adaptation missed the mark on almost every level, leaving it as one of the more forgettable entries in the fairy tale genre. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for a captivating retelling of a classic story.",1/10
"I have never seen a movie this bad in my entire life. The cgi is horrible, like how is this movie had more than 200 millions of budget and its still looked like trash. I watched this with my sister we got bored after 30 minutes, we just used our phones for the rest of the movie.

The dwarfs are painful to look at, they look so bad that I prefer smashing my head into a wall for 1 hour than rather to look at those abominations.

Rachel Zegler's voice is espectacular but she is just not the perfect person to be snow white. Gal Gadot's performance was the worst thing about this movie. She just have no emotion while acting.

The bob cut they gave snow white was horrendous, I actually feel kinda bad for Rachel because like they made her look like lord farquad.😭

Disney just ruined the whole movie by changing almost all the plot from the original movie and overall is not worth to watch, just save your money and time.",1/10
"Until you see it in person, you don't truly grasp the magnitude of this movie's disaster. Absolute disappointment. This film is not recommended, NOT even for those who might want to pirate it. A soulless script, stiff performances, and direction that seems more concerned with sending messages than telling an engaging story. The classic characters have been stripped of their essence, turning into mere shadows of what they once were.

The cinematography is flat, the music forgettable, and the runtime feels like torture. Disney has achieved the impossible: making a magical story feel boring and forced. If Snow White knew what they've done to her legacy, she would bite the apple within the first five minutes to spare herself the suffering.

The only redeeming quality, if any, would be the protagonist's voice, which at least manages to convey some emotion amid this cinematic shipwreck. But even that is not enough to save this catastrophe.",1/10
"I went with my friend and her 3 kids, aged 8, 6 and 4, her youngest was too young to go aged 2.

So a fairly young audience plus myself and my friend.

Ill try and give you some of the kids feedback although its not like i grilled them.

The 8 year old boy loved the dwarves and found them funny, he only liked 2 of the songs, High ho and the silly song and said the others were a bit boring.

Thr 6 year old girl was mesmerized from start to finish, loved all the songs but loves waiting on a wish, her mum says its on repeat on youtube.

The 4 year old boy managed to stay interested and quiet throughout and didnt say too much except he liked Dopey and Grumpy ( Dopeys dad apparently 😀😀 )

They all liked the mining cart sequence and want to do a mining cart ride. The 2 youngest found the witch scary especially as a hag but also as the queen. The eldest didn't find anything scary 😐😐.

The 2 eldest would watch it again, the youngest just shouted ' No' 😮

What did the adults think ?

Personally I found it ok, I thought Snow Whites dress was a bit cheap and cosplay looking but kind of fitted the cartoony vibe, her hair kind of annoyed me as well, it looked a bit out of place.

I liked the Dwarves animation and look, it matched the cartoon vibe and the original animation, plus they added a fun comedic vibe.

The songs were good, a few of the classics and some new additions. Waiting on a wish was very good, the opening song was really good as well ' good things grow ', very full of energy and had a greatest showman vibe.

I found the songs in this miles better than Mufasa - The Lion King, also this films pacing was a lot better especially for the kids. They never liked Mufasa and said it was boring.

The music overall was orchestral and strong, that was a huge positive.

Story wise its a classic tale of jealousy so nothing new on that front.

My friend enjoyed it as well but was just happy to be able to relax with the kids quiet for 90 mins 😀😀.

The kids response was probably an 8 or 9.

Id give it a 6.5 as it often looked a bit cheap at times but it did sound amazing.

Overall a 7.5/10. Kids loved it.",7/10
"I caught Disney's 2025 live-action Snow White in theaters and it was a complete letdown. The plot's a chaotic mess, stumbling over itself with no coherence, butchering the original's spirit. The dialogue's painfully awkward-I was squirming in my seat, stuck listening to it. Rachel Zegler's Snow White is a disaster, all sharp edges and aggression with no warmth or depth, making her insufferable. The CGI dwarfs are a tacky eyesore, and the pacing's sluggish, dragged down by sanctimonious rants that snuff out any magic. It's a cheap, hollow shell of a film that left me furious I didn't walk out sooner.",1/10

"I love the 1937 film. And while this SNOW WHITE is different than the original in some ways, it honors Walt Disney's vision beautifully.

Is there still a love story? YES! The film does not shame ""true love"". It deals with it in a delicate way and honors it. We also get an added layer to the plot, which includes a sort of Cinderella-esque background, with the evil queen controlling those around her. And this leads to another major plot point--Snow White's desire to honor and respect her father's wishes to be a decent and fair leader.

Gal Gadot is marvelous as the evil queen. The sound effects of her movements are crisp and startling, and yes, she is the fairest of them all-for now-- but only on the outside, of course. Her transformation into the ""innocent old lady"" is chilling!

The dwarves are delightful! They have such character! Doc is so endearing. Dopey is so sweet, and there is a pleasant twist he brings!

I highly recommend this movie if you appreciate sweet tales that promote integrity and fairness with uplifting and inspiring themes.",10/10
"I don't know what were people at Disney thinking making this movie? They have ruined a classic by making a movie that will forever remain as a stigma on its name. In addition the role didn't fit on characters especially Gal gadot .. should have casted someone else The movie felt soulless and unnecessary to be made.. wait for it for OTT release .. use that money to go out and eat....

Slow pace and dull dialogue and pretty obvious story .... Only thing they got right were dwarfs .... Nice animation Disney btw.

Here is my break down..... Story 9 for being classic.... Pace 0 Characters 0 Animation 5 Interesting 3.",1/10
"There's absolutely nothing to say that hasn't already been said - and sadly, nothing positive. Disney seriously needs to get its act together and return to making quality films instead of churning out this kind of nonsense. It's disheartening to see how far they've fallen. After wrecking both Star Wars and Marvel, their live-action remakes have become the next major letdown for fans. Snow White suffers from lackluster to downright poor acting, but even worse, it's completely devoid of heart. And the most painful part? That signature Disney magic - it's nowhere to be found. I wish it weren't true, but this film is excruciatingly bad.",1/10
"Went in to this with an open mind but my daughter got nothing from this. There's no story or meaning in the lessons told. It was an absolute mess and tragic modern update for such a classic. The acting is horrendous with both stars failing to land their characters. Gal gadot is her usual self minus the wonder woman outfit, same staunch face and acting. Cinematography was weak with most being CGI low effort scenes. Dwarves were used as a plot tool rather than any interesting characters from the original. Overall not worth your time. I worry now that it will mean kids of this generation won't watch the original now.",1/10
"It's the kind of film that puts you off paying money to go to the cinema, even my daughter gave up and asked to borrow my phone as she would rather scroll tiktok videos in silence than keep watching such a muddled plot. I watched it, but I couldn't give you anything other than a high level overview. The film had no idea what it wanted to be, only what it wanted to say. Outside of the songs, the film is just an aimless mess. If it weren't for Rachels pleasant singing voice, I would be giving a 1. Whomever signed off on that CGI for the dwarves as 'acceptable' needs to leave the profession and never come back.

Pinocchio, Little Mermaid, now even Mufasa... I feel sorry for the actors. They are clearly talented and competent people and were probably thrilled to be associated with a Disney production but Disney has lost something - and lost it hard, but with so many absolute turkeys on the bounce now they are skirting Uwe Boll territory - and not in a good way.",2/10
"Wow! What a performance by Rachel Zegler! She just nailed it. Her portrayl of snow white was just perfect, she gave a powerhouse of a performance. Her voice was just mesmerising in the movie. Her acting has also improved in this movie. This high rating is only for Rachel Zegler & her performance . On the other hand, Gal gadot's performance was hilarious. This type of poor performance is not expected from an experienced actress like her! Her acting could have been better, she needs to improve her game. The story of the movie made me nostalgic, it took me back to my childhood. The VFX of the movie wasn't as I expected! It wasn't up to the mark! Overall the movie is watchable & if you can ignore Gals acting you could enjoy the movie.",10/10
"I would write a whole essay on Gal's facial expressions. She is the worst actress. This is the last movie I will ever watch with her in the cast. Just skip over and watch any other movie.

I watched the movie with both of my kids and they noticed how bad her acting was. The girl playing snow white did much better in my opinion.

Even though the movie is a classic, Gal managed to botch the whole legacy. I am reconsiderring watching any disney classicz this has ruined a childhood memory of mine.

Disney if you are reading this, stop casting Gal and actors like her. You lost a lot of money, hopefully this is a lesson.",1/10
"Pleas don't take the risk of upsetting your children with this drivel. I played the original version to mine the day after viewing this rubbish, and their eyes lit up and enjoyment was evident in the original.

It seemed like a pointless 'story' trying to give a pointless and somewhat dangerous message, and it went absolutely nowhere.

I have never seen the whole audience of a cinema so uninterested. Some walked out and others just looked at their phones.

Even the children there, decided that playing quietly in the aisles was more fun than this so called fairy tale.

Utter rubbish.

What on earth is Disney thinking?",1/10
"Gal Gadot acting is horrible. Any movie she participates in get a 1 star review automatically. She ruins the whole movie. Specifically in this movie her performance was the worst, I've never seen a ""nice"" evil queen in my life. This movie will definitely get into Guinness records for the worst movie in history because of how bad her acting is. It's a shame that you ruined a great childhood story by doing such movie. I hope someone else does a new movie called Snow White to fix this trauma that you caused. I hope the image of Snow White is restored again by people after this new movie is prouced.",1/10

"Why ruin a movie most of us cherished back when we were children. The script, the acting, the pace. It was just bad.

Rather than building upon the original's magic, it drains the story of its heart and replaces it with a dull, uninspired retelling.

Speaking of the script, the dialogue sounds like it was written by an AI that was trained exclusively on fairy tale movie cliché.

This left me wondering why Disney continues to rehash its animated masterpieces when the magic is nowhere to be found. It's about time Disney came up with new stories instead of remakes.

Conclusion: If you ever wanted to see a movie that feels like a tax write-off, Snow White is the perfect choice.",1/10
"I went into the *Snow White* remake hoping for at least one redeeming quality, but Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen made that impossible. In what should have been a commanding, chilling, and elegant portrayal of one of Disney's most iconic villains, Gadot instead delivers a performance that is so forced and awkward that it completely takes you out of the film.

Zero Presence, Zero Threat The Evil Queen is supposed to be a menacing figure-sophisticated yet terrifying, with a presence that dominates every scene. Instead, Gadot comes across as someone playing dress-up rather than embodying the role. Her attempt at regal authority falls flat, as she lacks the charisma and depth needed to make the Queen compelling. Instead of exuding power, she simply looks bored, like she's reading lines off a teleprompter.

Forced and Unconvincing Line Delivery One of the biggest problems is her delivery. Every line feels overly rehearsed yet still unnatural, as if she's unsure whether she should be menacing or dramatic. The way she stretches out her words in an attempt to sound intimidating only makes her performance feel cartoonish. She doesn't command attention; instead, she makes the Queen feel like a parody of herself.

Her voice, which normally works well in action roles, doesn't suit the character here. The original Evil Queen had a deep, commanding tone that sent chills down your spine. Gadot's version lacks weight, and her exaggerated enunciation makes her sound like she's trying way too hard. The Queen should be effortlessly terrifying-not someone struggling to sound sinister.

Over-the-Top Yet Emotionless Acting Somehow, Gadot manages to be both over-the-top and completely emotionless at the same time. Her exaggerated expressions and awkward gestures make it clear that she's trying to act ""evil,"" but it never feels natural. Instead of embodying the role, she seems like she's in a school play, overacting without understanding the character's true essence.

The famous ""Mirror, Mirror on the wall"" scene, which should be chilling, ends up being laughable. Gadot's delivery is so stilted that it's impossible to take her seriously. There's no underlying malice, no quiet fury-just a forced attempt at being dramatic. Even when she plots Snow White's downfall, there's no real emotion behind her words. It's as if she's just going through the motions, rather than truly embracing the character's wickedness.

A Villain Without Depth The worst part is that the Queen, one of Disney's most iconic villains, ends up feeling flat and unmemorable. There's no nuance, no subtlety, and no real menace. The Queen's descent into obsession and jealousy is what makes her so compelling, but Gadot's performance completely misses this complexity. She doesn't come across as a cunning and dangerous ruler-just an actress who isn't suited for the role.

Final Verdict Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is one of the biggest reasons this remake fails. Instead of giving us a villain with gravitas and menace, she delivers a laughably bad performance that lacks depth, emotion, and credibility. If you want to see a truly terrifying Evil Queen, just rewatch the original animated *Snow White*. This version isn't worth your time.",1/10
"The main reason for this complete flop was Gal Gadot and her absolutely cringe performance. It was a really rough watch, all the way through. It's striking how one actor can completely ruin a film, but this shows that it is in fact possible. Hopefully Disney learns its lesson from this, but I doubt it. It was truly something where I had to look away and felt a sense of second hand embarrassment. Embarrassment for all those in the theater, and all those involved with making the movie, to have to deal with an actor that is so clearly dragging this movie down with it. There was potential here, but Gal Gadot completely squandered it. Historically bad.",1/10
"I'm uncertain whether this adaptation is rooted in a classic Disney story or if it represents a new take on the material. If it's the latter, I can appreciate the effort to bring fresh perspectives and interpretations to beloved tales, as it can introduce these stories to new audiences. However, if it is indeed based on a classic, I have concerns regarding the casting choices and the overall storytelling approach. The original narratives hold significant value, and any deviation from them can lead to mixed feelings among longtime fans. It's essential to honor the essence of these characters and their journeys. While I appreciate the creative effort behind this adaptation, I believe that staying true to the spirit of the original is crucial for maintaining its charm and impact. Ultimately, the success of such projects hinges on how well they resonate with both new and existing fans, and I hope that this adaptation finds a way to connect with audiences while honoring its roots. Thank you for the effort put into this project; it's always interesting to see how classic stories are reimagined for contemporary audiences.",1/10
"Disney's live-action ""Snow White"" is a lacklustre remake that fails to capture the magic of the original. Rachel Zegler's mediocre attempt cannot rescue the movie from its disjointed plot, over-reliance on CGI, and unoriginal songs and it definetly won't save you from boredom. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen fails to deliver the menace needed, rendering the central conflict implausible. The film's attempt at modernizing the age-old tale results in a muddled tone that neither honours the original nor offers an engaging fresh take. Overall, this adaptation feels like a soulless cash-grab, missing the magic and warmth that has made the animated film a time-tested classic.

Disney: Bring back the classics.",1/10
"This is such a terrible story line. Why did they need to change any of it. Knowing deep down Rachel wasn't going to do well; constantly causing drama and changing the whole story line to make her look good. No one wants to see this.

Her singing was so off compared to the real Snow White. Stop trying to make every character sound like Elsa from frozen. They don't need to scream the words at me when I'm watching it.

This needs to be taken down and changed. New actors for such a leading character. Saying she was ""stalked"" in the original story. It's about love and happiness. The new one is an abomination and needs to be remade. Without Rachel.",1/10
"Just an absolutely MISERABLE movie to have to sit and suffer through! Thankfully we both saw it for free, but we both still hated it so badly that we still felt ripped off. We wound up leaving before it ended because it was just THAT dang terrible! In all my 41 years I've never ever walked out on a movie until now. I firmly believe they should be watched entirely, but this was just impossible to do that with. I think I lost a good number of brain cells watching this absolutely pathetic crock. First Disney movie I've seen in probably 20 years. Definitely won't be making that mistake ever again.....",10/10
"This movie sucks. Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs may be a landmark in animation history, but that doesn't mean it holds up today. For a film often praised as a timeless classic, it feels more like a relic of outdated storytelling, weak character development, and over-simplicity.

The pacing of the film is also an issue. While it's only about 80 minutes long, it drags in parts, particularly with the excessive filler of the dwarfs' antics. Yes, they're cute, but their slapstick humor quickly becomes repetitive. Grumpy is the only one with even a semblance of personality, while the rest are essentially walking gags.

The Evil Queen, while visually striking, has one of the most nonsensical villain plans in Disney history. Instead of just killing Snow White outright, she goes through an elaborate scheme involving a poisoned apple that can easily be undone by ""true love's kiss."" Not exactly a foolproof strategy.",1/10
"I really tried to give ot a chance i grew up with disney after seeing this movie I wished I would have died with the good memories I have of it instead of now knowing disney has become this. I am devastated and sad the computer animations and well basically everything is so bad if I had to pic a songle one thing that was really great about it then I would say the very last second where you see ""The End"" is the absolute best part. Please just save your money time and your memorys if you must watch it for whatever reasion wait for it to roll in free TV but I would hesitate even then. It is up to you.",1/10
"The queen has been fairer than everyone on the set, making this installation of Snow White totally moot.

The threats from the queen were merely lip service as the only act of malice was an arrow being shot. Everything else from prison chains to the poison apple carried little efficacy. The reaction of the queen to each news she hears has been illogical.

Did the writers go on strike again? The script and dialogs could've been written by my high school drama club. The quality of costume is on par with my community theatre. The acting... again, I think my high school drama club would've done a better job LOL

There were no elements of ""enchantment"" or ""chemistry"" throughout. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was a materpiece and that was last decade! Have they not learned anything from past success?",1/10

After all, I could lay back and sleep with noise cancelling headphones if I so desired while she and my wife enjoyed the show.

At the insistence of the child that did not happen, so I was force fed this abomination that started with the ridiculous with the young Snow White and gradually arrived at an even more convoluted storyline by the end. By the half way mark even our grand-daughter was restless and complaining of how boring it all was. We'd all had enough by then but we forced ourselves through to the final credits and got out quickly. A couple did walk out long before that! Horrendous! Please avoid!",2/10

It is an insult to cinema, a disgrace to storytelling, and a disaster in every possible way. Every scene feels like torture, every moment drags on painfully, and the sheer incompetence on display is almost surreal. This film should be banned from being shown to children, it is so awful that even the devil himself would consider it a step too far. No one should ever have to suffer through this abomination. Watching it feels like punishment, a true cinematic nightmare.",1/10

"Went to see this re-make of a Disney classic with my spouse after hearing all the news about it. We are huge Disney fans and we went in with an open mind.

The story feels like it's trying to be three separate cuts of the movie all crammed into one. It's painfully obvious that they were not sure where this movie was supposed to go in post production. Many scenes feel cut short or slightly out of place. Not to mention the CGI looks like a rush job. We all know Disney can produce top notch CGI, but not here.

Overall I wouldn't even call this Snow White. It's trying to be but misses the mark entirely.",1/10
"Everything is out of place. Bad acting! Bad cinematography! Bad storyline! Disney really need to start taking things seriously before doing all these classical cartoon remakes. Why are you guys destroying what is supposing a nice and sweet story? Why is it so difficult to stick closely to the original features if you are planning to remake a live-action version of the original? Cast is really important and also the personality of the actors and actresses that you pick.

And 1 thing to point out is the bad camera angles throughout the whole movie! And why is DOPEY being able to talk in the movie?",1/10
"Personally, I disagree with the casting of Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler. Rachel Zegler is an amazing actor but wasn't right for this role, and Gal Gadot is... not a good actor at all, I really don't understand what they were thinking with her. And the costuming was terrible, truly. It draws away from the fantasy and feels more like a party city costume party than anything actually good. Snow whites dress was tacky and had a lack of depth in both color and silhouette, and the Evil Queens attire was vomit- inducing. It was basically a diving suit with sequins glued in, it looked terrible. And, again, Gal Gadot's acting pulled away from the entire story and her dialogue. Some of her music was genuinely nice, but Gal Gadots singing was so bad that it took away from the actual music and it's meaning. Terrible.",1/10
"This live-action is barely even Snow White. The story line is awfully reconstructed and the CGI was also subpar.

This movie seems as if they put the classic storyline of Snow White into chatGPT for AI to rewrite it with a couple modern buzzwords incorporated. The casting choice of Gal Gadot as the evil Queen should have said it all from the start to be honest, I got no emotion from any of the scenes involving her.

The rewriting of the plot also seems as if everyone involved in the making of it thinks that a woman wanting to find true love is a negative trait, and an unachievable goal. What's wrong with love Disney?

Some songs were catchy, but that does not make up for everything else the movie got wrong.

Disney should honestly stop making live action versions of their classics at this point, I hope they don't get to tangled....",1/10

The dwarves are also very bad. There is nothing in this movie that is well used, even the setting is bad, please don't watch it.",1/10
"I went to see Snow White with friends and family, despite all the bad reviews. Unfortunately, the experience confirmed the negative buzz and then some. A nearly empty theater set the tone for the experience. Ten minutes into the film, I could tell this was clearly a project more at home on television than the big screen, even if that.

The storyline felt disjointed and choppy. Key character arcs, particularly those involving the seven bandits, were left with glaring, unresolved gaps. One scene even had Snow White distracting pursuing soldiers by revealing a dress-only to find she was still wearing her familiar costume. Such moments only added to the film's overall sense of inconsistency.

Another problematic aspect was the evolution of the mirror on the wall. Initially, it famously declared the queen to be ""the fairest of them all,"" but by the film's end, it shifted its message entirely to one of inner beauty-a dramatic turn that felt both abrupt and unearned. Even the iconic moment of true love's kiss fell flat; lacking any buildup or emotion, it was decidedly anticlimactic and disappointing.

Perhaps the only entertainment value came from the opportunity to roast the film. My friend and I found ourselves roasting the movie, noting that even Dopey seemed to have been lifted straight out of Mad Magazine. In the end, it's hard to imagine a movie that bombing any harder than this one.",1/10
"How can I unsee this?

I gave this movie a try, but unfortunately, it didn't land well for me. One of the biggest issues was the overuse of CGI, it felt excessive and unnecessary, especially for a live-action film. It ended up looking more like a digital experiment than a cinematic experience. While I have nothing against the lead actress personally, her performance lacked depth and felt more like a high school play. The overall casting choices weren't compelling either. On top of that, the storyline and pacing just didn't hold my attention. It was difficult to stay engaged.

Not recommended at all.",1/10
"Should of never changed the original story to a new one, just because we live in 2025 doesn't mean everything should be changed to a ""newer"" time some of us like the love story and charm which this movie totally did not deliver. Could of been so much better in so many ways, starting off with the casting and then the CGI editing and all definitely was not the best. Disney what happened to all the magic you are supposed to show and give because this was probably one of the most boring movies I have ever watched. Maybe next movies you produce should be a very close remake of the original just a slight newer version not a complete different story. I have really been let down for a couple years now with your movies of some of my favorite childhood favs. What a waist of time and money.",1/10
"As always, whenever there's a negative hype around a movie, my mindset is always, prove them wrong, give it a chance.

It's diabolical, honestly, I can't understand how so much money and so much time has gone into this, the final result is cringe worthy. It is an absolute shocker, I am stumped to find any positives.

It looks and feels so artificial, the sets, the animals, as for The Dwarves themselves, I have no words to express my feelings there.

The biggest catastrophe, not what I was expecting if I'm honest, the worst offender, Gal Gadot, she looks sensational, but her performance, she's going to scoop some unwanted awards it's fair to say.

What I wasn't expecting, was just how poor the costumes would look on screen, Snow White's just doesn't translate very well, the hairstyle, what were they thinking?

Disney, what on Earth have you done?",1/10
"This movie is a disaster from start to finish. It's like they took a classic, squeezed out all the charm, and replaced it with cringe dialogue, lifeless performances, and a storyline that drags harder than a bad wig. The CGI looks like it was done on a 2010 laptop, the characters are flatter than cardboard, and the lead has zero screen presence. They tried so hard to be ""different"" that they forgot to be good. It's not just bad-it's offensively boring. Disney should've left this one in the vault. What a mess.

Every scene feels like it was written by an AI with commitment issues. Please, no more remakes if this is the standard.",1/10

"Trying to keep the bias out of my thoughts when I took my kids to this movie. I was bored within the first 20 minutes and usually engage with my kids about the movie's are watching, nothing to engage with here. Acting was subpar at best and doesn't live up to the animated Snow White in any way. Overall it was boring, the acting was clunky, and the lead actress was not fit for this role due to her acting capabilities. I wish Disney would stick to the magic that they used to have. Call me an old head but they just don't have what they used to. Bonding, life lessons, team work were all good values that used to be instilled. Maybe Disney will hear the audience and return to making gold.",1/10
"I've had so much nostalgia growing up, watching the original Snow White movie and loved the storyline and In all, which made me very excited to see the new movie, but everything was wrong. The plot how she looked that acting wasn't great and overall not a good movie. I don't recommend everybody to see this movie would be a waste of time and money. I also don't understand why they have to change the plot line to make the princess fierce and not want to be saved. When the whole movie is about that that's the plot line. People don't care people want to see the original storyline. The whole movie was just so wrong.",1/10
"Acting is horrible, Singing... was actually better than expected in some moments. Despite Racheal's insufferability, she can actually sing pretty well in most songs.

Visuals are horrible with the costumes looking just out of place and cheap. Don't even get me started on the plot. First off without spoilers, it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense, nor does it invoke any emotions even resembling interest. And the reshoots are very clear when you watch the movie.

I'm sure you get the point.

I came into the movie knowing it was going to be bad, and I'm glad it's worst than I expected. Movies like this should not be rewarded or find success

Don't watch this. Save yourself the time and money.",1/10
"This is the worst movie ever made-an absolute disaster from start to finish. Everything about it is awful: the writing is uninspired, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the pacing is unbearable. The characters are butchered beyond recognition, completely stripping away what made the original special. Rachel Zegler delivers one of the worst performances in film history-bland, forced, and completely lacking any charm. The filmmakers have no respect for the source material, turning a beloved classic into a soulless cash grab. The visuals are cheap, the effects look horrible, and the cinematography is dull. There's no magic, no heart, no effort. Every decision was a mistake, from the casting to the script to the overall vision. This film is nothing but a disgrace, an insult to the original and to audiences. It deserves every bit of backlash and criticism it gets. A soulless, corporate disaster that should have never been made. Watching this was a painful experience, and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. It's beyond terrible-one of the biggest failures in modern cinema. Avoid it at all costs.",1/10

"Disney's Snow White (2025) is a complete disaster, a soulless cash grab that fails both as a remake and as a standalone film. From the moment it starts, it's clear that the heart and magic of the original are nowhere to be found. Rachel Zegler's Snow White is uninspiring, lacking any of the warmth and charm that made the character beloved. Gal Gadot, despite her talent, delivers a painfully over-the-top performance as the Evil Queen, making it impossible to take her seriously.

The script is lifeless, filled with awkward dialogue and forced modernization that strips the story of any emotional depth. The pacing is horrendous, dragging on with scenes that feel empty and pointless. Even the visual effects, which should be one of the film's highlights given its massive budget, fail to impress. The CGI dwarfs are unsettling and lack personality, making them forgettable at best and cringe-inducing at worst.

Beyond the film's technical failures, the controversies surrounding it only added fuel to the fire. The unnecessary changes, from Snow White's character to the sidelining of classic elements, felt more like a corporate attempt at ticking boxes rather than a genuine effort at storytelling. Instead of delivering a fresh, exciting take on a timeless classic, Disney has given us a watered-down, painfully dull experience that no one asked for.

By the time the credits rolled, I found myself thinking that watching paint dry would have been a more entertaining and fulfilling experience. This film is proof that Disney has lost its touch, churning out soulless remakes that fail to capture the essence of what made their originals special. If this is the future of Disney live-action adaptations, we're in for a rough ride.",1/10
"I went into this film hoping for a fresh yet faithful take on Snow White, but what I got was a soulless, uninspired mess that completely misses the charm, heart, and magic of the original. Disney's attempt to modernize this beloved fairy tale resulted in a film that feels neither nostalgic nor innovative-it simply feels empty.

A Lead Character That Lacks Charm

One of the biggest issues with this adaptation is Snow White herself. The character in the original story was known for her kindness, innocence, and warmth-qualities that made her beloved by the dwarfs and the audience alike. In this version, however, she is rewritten into a completely different person, and not in a good way. Instead of a kind-hearted and gentle protagonist, we get a self-righteous, almost arrogant version of Snow White who lacks any real charm. There is no sense of wonder or joy in her journey, and she doesn't feel like a character you want to root for.

The performance also leaves much to be desired. There is no depth, no warmth, and no real emotional range. Every line delivery feels forced and unnatural, making it hard to connect with her character. It's a shame because a strong lead performance could have salvaged some of the film's weaker moments.

Where is the Magic?

Disney built its empire on telling magical, timeless stories, but this film has none of that. The whimsical atmosphere that made the original so enchanting is completely absent. The visuals are bland, the cinematography is uninspired, and even the fantasy elements feel generic. Instead of the rich, colorful world we expect from a Snow White adaptation, we get a film that looks strangely dull and lifeless.

The lack of effort in the CGI is another huge letdown. The creatures and backgrounds often look artificial and unfinished, making it hard to feel immersed in the world. When you compare this to Disney's past live-action films, the drop in quality is shocking. It's as if the studio didn't even try to create something visually memorable.

The Dwarfs Are an Afterthought

One of the most beloved aspects of the original Snow White is the seven dwarfs, each with their own distinct personality and charm. In this version, however, they are almost irrelevant. Instead of being integral to the story, they feel like last-minute additions that serve no real purpose. Their interactions with Snow White lack warmth and humor, and there is no real emotional bond between them.

This is one of the biggest disappointments of the film because the dwarfs added so much heart and comedy to the original. Without them, the movie feels even more lifeless.

The Villain is Forgettable

A great Disney movie needs a great villain, but the Evil Queen in this version is nothing special. In the animated classic, she was terrifying, elegant, and truly menacing. Here, she is just... there. She lacks any real presence or threat, and her motivations are vague at best. A weak villain makes for a weak story, and unfortunately, this.",1/10
"I'd like my time back on this one. This Snow White is not just a bad movie, it's an insult to the classic story and to anyone who dares to sit through it.

Let's start with the obvious: the heart and magic of the original are completely missing. Instead of a charming, timeless fairy tale, we get a watered-down, soulless attempt to modernize a story that didn't need fixing. Snow White herself is neither inspiring nor interesting, and the movie seems more focused on making a statement than telling a compelling story.

The dwarfs? Awkward, and add nothing to the film. The CGI is poor, the dialogue is painfully forced, and the humor? Nonexistent.

Then there's the villain, if you can even call her that. The Evil Queen, played by an actress who deserves far better material, is stripped of the menace and grandeur that made her iconic. Instead, she comes off as a generic, one-dimensional baddie without a hint of the elegance and terror we once knew.

The songs are forgettable, the pacing drags, and by the time the credits roll, you'll wonder why you wasted your time. Save your money. This one isn't worth a theater ticket-it's not even worth a streaming rental. Just rewatch the animated classic and pretend this mess never happened.",1/10
"This movie makes no sense. It is a complete disaster. My 5 years old was so upset because the cartoons she watched did not look the same in the film. Disney did not work on the script, horrible actor selection and extremely poor CGI. This movie has everything wrong with modern cinema. The lead actress has no charisma and is not talented to work on classics like Snow White. The screenplay is poor and filibustering. I highly recommend not watching this movie, it is indeed a big disappointment. Disney needs to change its leadership and must remember who the core audience is. If the parents don't like it, then the kids don't like it either. 5 years old are not paying to watch ridiculous movies.",1/10
"If you've ever gone into a movie expecting a thrilling, tightly-woven story, only to leave the theater feeling bewildered and frustrated, then you'll understand the agony of watching The Fateful Choice. This film started off as a promising premise but completely fell apart due to an inexplicably jarring plot twist and an utterly miscast lead that destroyed what little potential it had.

Let's talk about the plot first. Initially, The Fateful Choice seemed like it was going to be a gripping tale of a young woman struggling with personal demons and having to make a life-altering decision. The premise held promise: the idea of a protagonist being caught between two competing futures-one that could bring them joy, and the other, possibly doom-was ripe for deep emotional exploration. The early scenes set up a compelling narrative, giving us a protagonist that seemed to be facing real, tangible challenges, not just melodramatic hurdles.

But then, somewhere in the middle of the movie, something bizarre happened. The filmmakers decided to throw out the carefully crafted narrative and replace it with an over-the-top, unearned twist that felt completely disconnected from the film's original direction. This twist came out of nowhere and not in a clever, mind-bending way but rather in a ""let's just change everything and see what sticks"" kind of way. Characters made decisions that were out of character, key plot points were dropped without explanation, and any emotional resonance was drowned out by an almost comical turn of events. What was once a grounded drama suddenly became a mess of cheap thrills and nonsensical revelations.

It's a real shame because, for the first half of the film, The Fateful Choice felt like it was building to something meaningful. The cinematography was competent, and there was a subtlety in the way the story was unfolding. But after the plot twist, the movie quickly devolved into something unrecognizable, and not in a way that could be appreciated. It was simply a different movie altogether, and not a better one.",1/10
"If given the choice between watching paint dry and sitting through Snow White, I'd gladly grab a chair and stare at a freshly coated wall. At least with drying paint, there's a sense of progression-you can watch it shift from glossy to matte, observe the subtle changes in color, and maybe even find some oddly satisfying patterns forming. Snow White, on the other hand, is a slow, saccharine ordeal filled with outdated animation and a plot that drags on with little excitement. The high-pitched singing, the one-dimensional characters, and the painfully predictable storyline make it feel like time is standing still. At least with paint drying, there's no forced cheerfulness or annoying dwarfs singing in unison-just peaceful, quiet monotony, which is infinitely more appealing.",1/10
"I mean no words needed for what a 💩 this movie is even. Didn't expect much from it since they talked bad about the old movie. Did not like the acting, outfits and general nothing good about this. Disney really dug their own grave with this. I don't understand why they had to make a live action version of this movie or any movie for that matter. It is unnecessary. I guess they are short on money and ideas so they have to bring up the same things over and over again. It is not worth the time or the effort they put into this cz ghere isn't any effort at all. Like disney please get over yourself and start making new and unique things.",1/10
"I absolutely loved this take on Snow White. The main actress' singing was beautiful-emotional, strong, and full of heart. The scenery and costumes were breathtaking, drawing me into a rich, magical world that felt both timeless and fresh.

What really stood out to me, though, was the story itself. My favorite part was that Snow White reclaimed her kingdom not through war or violence, but by truly connecting with her people. She remembered their names, saw their kindness, and recognized what made them uniquely human. Her strength wasn't just in her title-it was in her compassion and wisdom. She didn't measure the success of her reign by gold or power, but by the quality of life of those around her. That message was beautiful and deeply moving.

We need more movies like this right now!",10/10
"I went to see this movie today with my mother and my daughter. If I had not been there with the two of them, I would have walked out of the theater and left without finishing the movie. Very few parts of this movie were cute or entertaining. For the most part I was bored to tears, without exaggeration I caught myself starting to fall asleep at one point and had to excuse myself to stretch my legs. I grew up watching Disney movies and this was just a massive disappointment. The acting was subpar, the music was not enchanting or catchy with the exception of hi ho. Most of the time the set looks like something out of a B rated movie. At one point the main male character is climbing on what is supposed to be a boulder but it wasn't well secured so it shakes and rocks when they touch it. Additionally, the costume choices looked cheap and were not well done. Snow White needed a new stylist because that uneven haircut was not doing anything for her, and they could have at least thrown some actual red lipstick on her. My mother and daughter liked the movie okay, but neither of them will be watching it again. My expectations going into this movie were pretty low, yet it still managed to disappoint.",1/10
"I can't believe I saw this piece of trash. A complete waste of life time that I will never get back. I wish I could rate this a zero.

Why do they do this? Why ruin classic stories with new era nonsense? Why did this film need to be created at all? What's the point?

How many times must they be taught the lesson that these garbage films are not going to make a lot of money and are just going to poison the brand to any future efforts to do something positive with classic properties and stories?

I hope they get someone in charge at Disney that puts an end to this sort of movie once and for all.",1/10
"I don't know at what point they considered that this is a good movie. The poor acting, the most horrible Cgi, is not made to adapt the original, but to destroy it and very little was left of it. I must applaud Rachel's voice but even her appearance does not fit the character of Snow White, And neither did Gal Gagot with his poor singing and acting, I hope with all my heart that Disney will reconsider and not continue destroying the fairy tales that most of them, including me, grew up with, and return to good live action ones like Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast was a great example. But at this rate they are going to ruin.",1/10

Millions wasted on another horrible remake. Miss when Disney used to actually make good movies it's unfortunate what the company as come to and this movie is a great example of how far Disney has fallen.

"This movie was the worst Disney movie I have ever seen.

I'm not opposed to the live action. Disney remakes I think when done well they add a new element to the old stories but this remake was just awful. I feel this remake has done the Brothers grim story a disservice.

Rachel Zegler although I believe being incorrectly cast for the roll was a star. Her voice was amazing and her acting matched. I also found Andrew Burnap did a great job. Unfortunately that's all the positives I could take away from the movie. I stayed until the end even though at around the 10 minute make I was ready to walk out.

"The Blender 3D animation is a cringe-inducing throwback to the early 2000s, with clunky, robotic movements and a main actress who delivers a performance so atrocious-wooden, uninspired, and painfully devoid of charisma-that it sinks the entire film.

The visuals are dated and unrefined, exuding a cheap, artificial vibe that screams low effort. Worst of all, the story is mangled beyond recognition, hacking the timeless fairy tale into a bizarre, incoherent mess that defies logic and strips away its soul.

Fans feared this, and it's exactly what we got: a hollow, disrespectful cash-grab that fails to enchant or entertain.

Utterly deplorable.",1/10
"Without meaning in all its duration, there can be no recreation of an animated classic that loses the essence of what makes it magical. If they wanted to modernize a classic, they should have done so using a more intelligent approach.

Not even Disneyland princesses could relate to this garbage. There are surely many better ones out there with more knowledge and training.

. TRASH .

Better nothing. What's the point of Disney as a company? Understand that it's just about making money and exploiting titles that once made them profit. But they are so stale inside that they do not know how to distinguish what it is to make a well-made film with passion.

The protagonist actress... is a lost cause not even worth mentioning.",1/10
"Disney, thank you so much for destroying and ruining all the nostalgia and beautiful memories you created for us with this movie....

I don't understand the reason for all this insistence on destroying beautiful works and stories. If you really can't make films based on the original story, don't ruin the entire work.

Don't start a period of self-destruction of stories, let the audience enjoy and understand the essence of the story and the characters.

This theft and destruction of the main principles of the story has never been and will never be interesting.

I feel so sorry for the new generation that has to see this nonsense and make memories with it...

"Compared to this ""film"", not only the 1937 cartoon itself looks like a masterpiece, but even the film ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" looks quite watchable. I don't know what Disney was thinking when they released such trash, but I was one of those who did not sit until the end of the session and ran away from the cinema. Everything is done at an absolutely terrible level, the only tiny plus of this film is Gal Gadot in the role of the Evil Queen, thank you for her. Now I'm more interested in seeing a funny parody of this film, that's what I'd watch with BIIIIG pleasure. Conclusion: Spoil the classics? Only modern Disney can do that! 1/10!!!",1/10
"It's not as magical as the original, but it's still heartwarming! I anporeciated that many things were real- some of the sets, definitely the costumes. The CGI facial expressions on the dwarves were impressive! And the message is one of goodness and kindness. It's just wholesome. The music is fun and promotes goodness! The new songs were sweet. The wicked queen's songs are not exactly in her character, but they're still fun. Great singing! And it's nice to have a good old love story on the screen. We need more kids movies like this one. It teaches us to share, spread kindness, and that beauty comes from within.",5/10
"Disney's latest live-action remake of Snow White is yet another disappointing attempt to cash in on nostalgia while completely missing what made the original so beloved. This film strips away the charm, heart, and magic of the 1937 classic, replacing it with a lifeless, uninspired story that feels more like a generic fantasy film than a true adaptation of a Disney legend.

The biggest issue is the screenplay. The film attempts to modernize the character of Snow White but does so in a way that makes her completely unrelatable. Instead of a kind and warm-hearted heroine, we get a bland and overly serious protagonist lacking any emotional depth. The supporting characters are just as forgettable, and the absence of the iconic seven dwarfs in their traditional roles is a huge misstep.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some of the CGI looks polished, other effects come off as artificial and unconvincing. The production design lacks the whimsy of the original, and the cinematography is dull and uninspired. Even the musical elements feel out of place, with songs that fail to capture the magic of the classic soundtrack.

Overall, Snow White is yet another unnecessary and underwhelming live-action remake from Disney. Instead of reimagining the story with respect for its origins, it strips away everything that made the original timeless. Fans of the 1937 classic will likely walk away disappointed, wondering why Disney keeps insisting on remaking masterpieces without understanding what made them special in the first place.",1/10
"Rachel carried this movie ENTIRELY. Like genuinely it wouldn't be morning without her performance. Rachel is such an extremely talented, beautiful, and amazing actress and performer. Her voice is beautiful and she completely embodies Snow White and what a Disney princess stands for. I absolutely cannot wait to see more of her in the future and I hope she finds lots of success despite the awful hate train Disney has been sending to her. The movie was fine, I feel some things could've been done differently and Gal Gadot's performance was extremely lackluster and at times just flat. Other than that though I enjoyed it a lot!",10/10
"Disney's live-action Snow White is a breathtaking reimagining of the beloved classic, blending nostalgia with modern storytelling. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is both mesmerizing and menacing, bringing depth to the iconic villain. The film's visuals are stunning, from the intricately designed castle to the enchanting forest, and the CGI seamlessly brings the seven dwarfs to life. The musical score masterfully balances the original's timeless melodies with new compositions by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, enhancing the film's emotional impact.

Beyond its technical brilliance, this adaptation explores themes of self-discovery, courage, and justice, presenting a fresh take on the classic fairy tale. It pays homage to the original while offering new perspectives, making it both timeless and relevant. With outstanding performances, dazzling visuals, and a heartfelt narrative, Snow White is a true triumph-an instant classic worthy of a perfect 10 out of 10.",10/10
"I went in unsure what to expect and was totally blown away! The new songs were amazing, the plot changes were great, the costumes were so fun, and the sets were so beautiful. I love how they honored the original film, but gave new life to the story in a way that makes me so excited to show my daughter. This is by far one of the best live action remakes yet! They did a really great job of adding grey to black and white characters and moving them beyond one dimension. I think a lot of the low reviews are related to people's personal feelings about the actors and not the actual film. I can't wait to watch it again!",10/10
"While once in a blue moon a remake does a decent job, this movie does not.

There's a reason why the 1937 film was so beloved, it had everything--innocence, drama, suspense, good triumphing over evil, kindness, romance. Songs that fit the action and are memorable. And all of it done superbly. It truly is a masterpiece, and from what I have read, Walt Disney was justifiably proud of its creation.

The 2025 version is not. It is a travesty. Please, do not waste your money and time going to see it. Others have remarked about the songs and CGI and poor acting. If you've seen the 1937 original, the 2025 one will just make you weep.",-/10

It makes people to believe to be the person you are and be you and teaches that beauty comes inside not from the outside and be who you are that makes you beautiful.

It can make you feel empowered to what you believe in and be the person that you are and stand up for yourself and fight for your right for your right to fight back and be the person that people see that you are and be prepared to fight back that is truly yours.",10/10
"Disney's new take on Snow White stumbles from the outset, failing to capture the magic and heart of the beloved classic.

Meant to modernize the fairy tale, the reworked story instead comes off as lifeless, with shallow characters and forced dialogue.

Rachel Zegler's performance as the titular princess is especially disappointing; while her singing voice shines, she never truly embodies the warmth or innocence fans expect.

Meanwhile, the CGI-once a Disney hallmark-feels distractingly cheap, from artificial forests to awkwardly reimagined dwarfs. Even the film's musical numbers, usually a highlight of these remakes, are marred by bland, forgettable songs that do little to recapture the enchanting spirit of the original.

Despite its attempts at relevance, this adaptation neither pays heartfelt homage to Snow White's timeless appeal nor introduces a compelling new vision. The movie falls short on nearly every front, leaving viewers longing for the genuine wonder and emotional resonance of the 1937 masterpiece.",1/10
"Was extremely excited to see how Rachel Ziegler interpreted the character of Snow White, but this movie was horrible. It is emotionless and borderline a struggle to sit through. It's a shame my favorite princess was handled like this. Maybe Disney should take this as a sign to stop making remakes, their new animation is where their energy should be devoted towards. Also, the casting of Gal Gadot was a horrible idea I do not understand why Hollywood continues to use her. Furthermore, the animation of the Seven Dwarfs was counterintuitive to the premise of being a ""life-action remake"" of a classic film. Extremely disappointed is and understatement to how I feel about Snow White (2025).",1/10
"This movie is absolutely horrible, mainly due to Gal Gadot's acting. How did she even get this role? She delivers her lines so awkwardly, and her performance feels unprofessional. Her portrayal completely ruins the character and takes away from the magic of the story. Disney made a huge mistake casting her. On the other hand, Rachel is adorable and clearly talented, but her performance is overshadowed by her co-star. It's disappointing to see such an iconic book and movie adaptation handled so poorly. Gal's casting was a disaster, and this film doesn't do the original justice. I'm happy Disney lost so much money.",1/10
"The whole thing felt like 1 half of 2 movies mashed together, no character development, and too rushed despite how long the movie is. There's never a sense of thrill or dread, just ""oh this happened but I'm okay now and must find my true self."" It's just not it, even for kids today. It doesn't really have any meaningful lessons or scenes to inspire any children. The so called ""Prince"" isn't there but instead is a bandit that doesn't really seem to give off any indication of trying to be a male lead, it's as if they either told him to not be too heroic or he's just acting like that. The famous kiss scene is also very anticlimactic, it felt like it was reshot and forced in last minute because of early critics.",1/10
"Let us start with the cinematography. You feel as if only first year students were hired for this film. The editing was terrible, the always blurry background to focus on the actors gave headaches, and the visual effects/CGI appeared to be from the early 2000's.

You will not leave this film feeling as if you enjoyed a Disney film, but more with your head tilted wonder what just happened. There is no story line or plot and has no flare at all.

If you are going to see this film, you should first get some migraine pills as the filming and editing causes some eye strain with way too much out of focus scenes.

If anything do a tilt effect lens and speed up the film x2 to be enjoyed. I am shocked the amount of money spent on this film as most home film enthusiasts could create this from home using today hardware and software.",1/10
"I went into Snow White hoping for at least a half-decent villain, but Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is about as threatening as a Disney Channel mean girl. She's supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the kingdom, yet somehow, she lacks the presence to sell it. Her performance is a mix of exaggerated smirks and awkward line delivery.

Overall, Snow White was already a questionable remake, but Gadot's casting as the Evil Queen cemented it as a disaster. A movie with an evil queen should at least be entertaining. Instead, we got a villain with the personality of a department store mannequin.

Would not recommend-unless you need a sleep aid.",1/10
"Reviewing the new Snow White 2025, I feel like many efforts were made on the wrong choices in this movie. It's evident that a lot of hard work was put into rewriting the story and enhancing the special effects, but honestly, those aspects should have been left untouched. The magic of the original fairy tale was in its simplicity, and by overcomplicating it with unnecessary changes, the movie loses its charm. It's frustrating to see such a classic story altered when the focus should have been on staying true to the essence of the characters and plot. These kind of works from Disney are truly ruining the legacy and value of its name...",1/10
"I honestly loved it, Rachel has an truly amazing voice and knowing that she sand live like she did in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes makes it even better! Her acting was beautiful and I thought they wrote it in a way that made the classic a little more modern and realistic for todays societal norms and expectations. Live action aren't just remakes of a movie but they modernise the movie and transform it to fit today's technology and society standards so I think k the movie perfectly embodied what it should of. Please go watch it!!! The music has been stuck in my head for days now! My only complaint would be Gal Gadot's song, it's a bit of a hit or miss for people and unfortunately for me it's a miss, but I truly don't understand any of the Rachel Zegler hate, she is amazing!",10/10
Asolutely horrible. Myself and my children were very disappointed. I went into the movie with an open mind believing that maybe people were being to harsh due to the pre showing publicity. I was flabergasted that this movie made it into production at all. The character developement was terrible. The storyling seemed jumbled. It did not have any of the characteristically good feeling moments a normal Disney film furnishes the audiences. I hope there's not a Snow White part 2!!! The movie should not be seen in the theaters. It's time our family will never get back. Movies are always a gamble but usually I can give a movie a 60 to 70% rating. Not in this case.,1/10
"Sadly, you have to give a minimum of 1 star, and even that is being generous. Not sure what the brass at Disney have decided on this Century, but it seems bent on destroying the memories of all the great Disney Classics, with garbage remakes that are complete disasters. My Grandson after 20 minutes asked if we could leave Snow White. There were only 2 other groups in the theater with their kids, and we all ended up walking out, leaving the place bare. It is just complete garbage, and wouldn't even be worth watching on network TV for free. Just don't go, you'll thank me later. The acting is horrible, the new vision of a classic tale destroys the work and memories of what old Walt did, and makes you think his ghost would be crying at what Disney has become. The actress who plays Snow White, her name is not even worth remembering, has about as much depth as a blank piece of paper. As an adult, I just really kept hoping to see her character get eaten by a bear, to end this journey of cringe on film. I would truly be surprised if I were to ever see her in another lead role again, and would suggest she memorizes the line ""would you like fries with that burger""",1/10
This movie is so bad like I don't recommend it to anyone no wonder why the cinema was open cause of how bad it is cheap effects it's like a bunch of high school kids came up with the idea to make a movie and the snow white actress came out saying we just hating smh Disney it's very sad how your downfall started you went from making people's dreams to ruining it for us just come up with something new for the future. Maybe stop taking old films and just remaking it if you gonna do that at least make sure you use the same plot cause this Is people ls childhood you playing with I'm telling you....,1/10
"Strayed too far from the original story line which didn't make much sense. Casting could have been better as well. It is no wonder why this got the reviews it did, jokes aside was just not a good movie. That is the problem these days, constantly making remakes of old movies which were fine to begin with because someone wants to put their ""artistic"" twist on things. What ever happened to coming up with an actual original concept instead of piggybacking off of previously successful ideas? The movie may have been more successful if it had just followed the original storyline but still, move on from the past and come up with something new and exciting that people actually want to watch for a change.",1/10
"Watched it with my 2.5 year old, 11 year old, and husband. We all thought it was a good movie and enjoyed it. My big kids only complaint was ""too much romance"" because there were two mildly romantic scenes. I prefer the lesson of being taught to my kids that the fairest/kindest of all is what is most important vs fairest/most beautiful. I feel like all the hate is people who never actually watched the movie? The music was phenomenal, I already added a few songs to my spotify. They managed to respect the original storyline while giving Snow White actual depth, which I appreciated. Also, for the folks concerned about CGI Dwarves, they casted people with dwarfism as actual humans with important roles in the story.",8/10
"To all the negativity about this movie, I strongly disagree. Everyone has a right to their opinion but people are just being really picky and have nothing better to do just to hate. My daughter and I just watched it and we loved everything about it!!! It was fun and magical and nothing wrong with the acting. The singing was great and fun. It's just really disappointing to hear most of the stupid reasons why people don't like the movie etc... maybe these people need more magic in their life and are just boring and picky. Again, great movie and nothing wrong with it. We enjoyed it very much and can't wait to watch it again when it comes out on Disney plus.",9/10
"I don't recommend films that follow this ""lead"". It's just not good. So if you want to watch a good movie you may as well stick to the originals these days.

"Rachel Zegler is the best thing of the movie. But Gal Gadot as the evil queen is painful to watch, her acting is way too bad for a production like this; I suffered through every minute she was on screen. The plot tries to give Snow White more personality than the original but doesn't quite reach the mark with adding it to the storyline. The cgi isn't good either? And what's the point in not casting little people for the 7 dwarves so it's not inappropriate, if you're going to cast a woman who literally spends her time spewing hate and misinformation and promoting a genocidal army she herself was part of? Not very congruent. Don't watch this movie.",1/10
"I loved it! The songs were great and very catchy. Snow Whites voice is lovely. The dwarves are so cute, great animation. My favourite is Dopey! Their mining scene is brilliant, those dwarves must be rich with the amount of gems. And all the forest animals, adorable! Their animation is very detailed, you would think they are real. I love when they interact. The Evil Queens outfits are amazing, so detailed and blingy. The visuals are great, a stunning Castle, and the forest is beautiful. Overall a fun and enjoyable movie. I disagree with everyone complaining, I think it is a great worthwhile live action remake. Whistle while you work 🎶",10/10
"This so-called adaptation of *Snow White* is an embarrassing misfire on every level. From the wooden performances of the main cast to the baffling deviations from the original story, the film feels like a cheap imitation rather than a genuine reimagining. The lead actress delivers her lines with all the emotion of a cardboard cutout, making it impossible to care about her journey. The supporting cast isn't much better-overacting, awkward delivery, and zero chemistry drag down every scene.

Worse yet, the script butchers the heart of the fairy tale, replacing its timeless charm with dull, modernized tropes that add nothing of value. The pacing is a mess, bouncing between rushed plot points and painfully drawn-out filler. Even the visuals, which should at least offer some spectacle, feel flat and uninspired, with lazy CGI and unimaginative set designs.

Disney's animated classic succeeded because it balanced warmth, humor, and genuine stakes-this film has none of that. Instead, it's a soulless, corporate product with no respect for the source material or the audience's intelligence. Save yourself the agony-skip this trainwreck and rewatch the 1937 masterpiece instead.",1/10
"This film isn't just bad-it's a soul-crushing, mind-numbing, patience-destroying abomination that should be locked away and never spoken of again. Watching it felt like being trapped in an elevator with someone explaining their dream in excruciating detail-except somehow worse. It's not just a failure; it's a crime against storytelling, a disgrace to cinema, and an insult to anyone unfortunate enough to sit through it.

Let's start with the script-or what I assume was a pile of incoherent notes scribbled on napkins and then fed through a shredder. The dialogue is so horrifically written that I genuinely wondered if the writers had ever heard real human beings talk before. Characters don't have conversations; they just spew nonsense at each other with all the charm of a malfunctioning robot. Every attempt at humor lands with a deafening silence, and the so-called dramatic moments are about as moving as a wet cardboard box.

The acting? If it were any stiffer, the cast would be mistaken for department store mannequins. The lead actor looks permanently confused, as if they wandered onto set by accident, while the supporting cast delivers performances so atrocious that I suspect they were being held hostage and forced to act against their will. There is zero chemistry between any of the characters, making every interaction feel like an awkward school play where no one bothered to rehearse.

The pacing is an absolute nightmare. Some scenes drag on so long that I started questioning my own existence, while others are so rushed that they barely make sense. The film somehow manages to be both painfully slow and completely incoherent at the same time, which should be impossible, yet here we are.

Visually, it's a complete disaster. The cinematography is so lazy that half the shots look like they were filmed on a potato, and the lighting is so bad that at times I thought my screen was broken. The special effects (if you can even call them that) are laughably bad-like something from a low-budget student film, but without any of the charm. The editing is so jarring that I felt like I was watching a series of random clips stitched together by someone who just discovered video software five minutes before the deadline.

And the soundtrack-oh, the soundtrack. Imagine the worst, most ill-fitting music choices possible, then somehow make them even worse. It's like they picked random tracks from a free stock music website and just threw them in with no thought whatsoever. At times, the music is so loud and overbearing that it drowns out what little dialogue there is, which honestly might be a blessing in disguise.

By the time the credits mercifully rolled, I felt like I had aged ten years. This film didn't just waste my time-it actively stole my will to live. If I had to choose between watching it again or stepping on a thousand LEGO bricks barefoot, I'd take the LEGO bricks every single time. Do yourself a favor: burn every copy of this film you come across, warn your loved ones, and pretend it never existed.",1/10
"Gal Gadot's acting in this film is laughably bad. Her performance is the theatrical equivalent of cardboard dipped in glitter - all shimmer, zero substance. Every line delivery is painfully stiff, devoid of depth or nuance. She doesn't command the screen; she awkwardly stumbles through it. The Evil Queen is supposed to be a character brimming with venom and complexity. Gadot gives us none of that. Instead, we're treated to a cringeworthy parade of exaggerated expressions and flat intonation, as if she's reading her lines for the first time at a table read.

It's hard to overstate how much she drags down the film. Scenes meant to be intense or emotionally charged land with a thud, thanks to her lifeless presence. Her portrayal is not only unconvincing - it's distracting. You can almost feel the supporting cast trying to act around her, like they're desperately trying to salvage some kind of emotional weight from a performance that gives them absolutely nothing in return.

There are plenty of things wrong with this film - from its soulless visual effects to the uninspired changes to the original story - but Gal Gadot's performance is undoubtedly the worst offense. It's astonishing that someone with such a high-profile role could be so utterly miscast and ill-prepared. If Disney wanted to kill off interest in Snow White for a generation, congratulations - mission accomplished.",1/10
"I didn't have very high hopes for this movie considering most of Disney's live action remakes are average, but this was terrible.

The acting was cringeworthy. Rachel Zegler was fine, but awkward in many moments. Gal Gadot's acting was atrocious and did not capture any of the original Evil Queen vibes. She did not come off as threatening or possess anything similar to the original, villainous demeanor.

The overall look of this movie wasn't very pleasing to the eye, especially considering the dwarfs were CGI and uncanny looking. Rachel Zegler's appearance as Snow White did not look good at all. The costume was very tacky, poor looking in quality, and seemed like something you could find at a Party City. The Disney parks have better costumes then this movie. Rachel's hair was styled in such a way that her hair looked like it was defying volume and did not resemble snow white whatsoever. Gal gadot's costume also looked off-putting and cheap.

This movie did not seem like Snow White at all, consisting of a plot going in a drastically different direction than the original movie, making many scenes seem out of place, awkward, and/or unnecessary. At some points, I had to remind myself I was watching a remake of snow white and not a random, poor quality movie.

The character development was tasteless, nothing felt enchanting like the original movie did, and this remake sucked out all of the charm of Snow White.

The musical aspect of the movie wasn't terrible, but it definitely couldn't make up for the rest of the trash presented on the big screen.

Overall, don't waste your money seeing this. Disney has produced a dumpster fire.",7/10
"A score of one is still too high of a rating for this miserable movie. Don't bother to go and see. May it disappear into the dustbin of history. Horrible acting. Bad timing. Miserable to try and watch. Bad movie all around. Sorry to see a classic be destroyed by an attempt to remake classical movie history. Can we just stick to the basic premise next time Disney? Why go and make something ""new"" and st the same time destroy the old? The actors and actresses involved make a person wonder if they have ever acted before. Was this their first time? If so, then I fault the director and producers. Disney should be ashamed.",1/10
"So disappointed.

How is it even possiblie to go so far from the original story?

CGI used in an hilarious way, I can swear the dwarfs was just made to scare the kids and repulse the mature audience. Snow white being well... not Snow white. Gals acting as is stiff and disconnected as always.

Acting was performed like there was a feeling of ""please just let me go home and be over with this""

It's like this movie was just made for money, played for money and not even want to be played.

Creativity: None Feeling: None Deep: None Respect to the original story: None.

The only thing to regret more than seeing this is how much money it made.",1/10
"Subpar and a pure disappointment. Disney needs to step up their game. This was not a tribute to the original production from 1937. Stop destroying classic productions. When people think of live action productions they expect real people. I felt like this destroyed the original magic that made Snow White.

For the amount of money poured into this production I would expect 10x on what was delivered. Subpar CGI at best. I feel like movies 15 years ago delivered better CGI.

They probably should have just spent the money somewhere else. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. Get principal Disney needs to learn.",1/10
"This remake misses on so many levels. Remaking a classic is always fraught with issues, but the writers and director didn't seem to care. Without going into deeper details, they completely cut two of the classic songs that anyone familiar with the original would want to see in this remake. How do you justify that? Shouldn't a live action remake of a classic cartoon be, as much as possible, a carbon copy of the original as possible? I could write more, but it's not necessary at that point. You can't remake a classic and omit the classic scenes and still claim it to remake. The costumes are good and I have no issue with a Hispanic playing the role of Snow White. She looks great. But the rest of it goes downhill from there. One star.",1/10
"Wow, beautiful movie. I just adored it. I've never been a huge Snow White fan but this has converted me! I always found the original to be a bit boring and lackluster. I loved the story and the songs that were created for it were wonderful and just what you expect from a Disney film. Rachel Zigler is a perfect Snow White and has the right voice while Gal Gadot is the perfect Evil Queen. I didnt know Gal had a great voice.

Anyway, I love a courageous princess! This live remake is my new favorite, de-throning The Little Mermaid and Aladdin in my opinion. The live remakes can be a hit or miss but this one was a hit. Highly recommend if you're a Disney fan.",10/10
"Disney's Snow White remake is a disaster. Stripped of its original magic and heart, it feels like a cynical cash grab rather than a tribute to a beloved classic. Rachel Zegler's performance lacks the charm and innocence the role demands, coming off as smug and uninspired. The soul of the original is nowhere to be found, replaced with hollow messaging and lazy storytelling. Disney has clearly lost its creative compass, and this film is yet another misstep. Maybe it's finally time to close the book on what once was the house of timeless tales. And not just the studios, but the parks and everything and just remember it all for the magic it once held.",10/10
"I can't begin to explain this movie. The casting is just wrong. How could they choose so poorly. The acting was below par. Costume wise they chose to make the characters look cheap and more like costumes bought of the internet. Effects are okay, but for Disney it's not even close to acceptable quality. It's beyond my understanding that this movie made it out to the public. Why did nobody in te working process of it say "" let's stop this dreadful mess before it's too late "". I can't keep myself from being worried about how Disney keeps making the same mistakes over and over again. Well, that's the short description of what I felt watching this movie.",1/10
"I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed the new Snow White! Visually, it's absolutely stunning - the costumes, set design, and cinematography all bring a fresh, magical energy to the classic tale. The performances were heartfelt and full of charm, especially from the lead, who brings both warmth and strength to the role. I appreciated the modern twists without losing the story's timeless core. This isn't just a rehash - it's a bold reimagining that dares to do something different, and for that, it deserves praise. The film strikes a beautiful balance between nostalgia and progress, offering something new while still feeling familiar. Don't let the noise fool you - this is a sincere, visually enchanting film that absolutely deserves to be seen. It may not be what some expected, but perhaps that's the point. Sometimes magic looks a little different than we remember - and that's okay.",10/10
"Disney's new ""Snow White"" film exemplifies how remakes can lose the charm of the original without adding value. Despite its hefty $270 million budget, the result is disappointing. The film lacks vitality and comes across as a purely commercial endeavor devoid of artistic creativity. Performances are lackluster, particularly Rachel Zegler as Snow White, who fails to exude the necessary charisma. Gal Gadot, portraying the Evil Queen, doesn't bring the required depth to her character. The visual effects are unappealing, resembling Al-generated imagery, making for an uncomfortable viewing experience. Additionally, drastic changes to the storyline, such as the removal of the glass coffin, strip away the classic elements beloved in the original. Overall, the film is a significant disappointment and reflects a decline in the quality of Disney's recent productions.",1/10
"I get that it gets bad reviews. I am too sort of disappointed by this remake because of the lack of ambition from Disney original title, they definitely could have done better. Animations are nice, but don't really understand where the whole budget is spend ?

Thinking it took 3 years for Disney and that amount of money is deceiving.

BUT

Rachel Zegler did an amazing job there from the singing and acting, she really is something else in this film. Modern princess and I loved that. Gal Gadot got some nice FEW lines but it didn't worked for me, she's got that look for the evil queen but the acting was not my cup of tea

Thank you Rachel, you did great!!! 😃 Disney, see you next time.",6/10
"The CGI was really poor and took me out of the experience. I hadn't followed the casting issues before the release, but they should have either used real actors or put more effort into the visuals. It wasn't just the dwarves-the forest and other scenes looked cheaply done as well.

A couple of the songs were okay, but by that point, I was just waiting for the credits. As for the acting, it felt lifeless, like the cast was just going through the motions. Snow White's lines sounded unnatural and forced. Maybe a different actress could have made it more convincing, but the script didn't help either. The original had a charm that this version completely lacked.

Overall, this felt more like a low-budget streaming release than a big Disney production. I've seen better CGI in TV shows with smaller budgets and much better acting elsewhere. Unless your kids are really eager to watch it, I'd recommend waiting until it's available for free. It's just not worth the price of a ticket.",1/10
The movie is cool. A little to much singing for me maybe 2 songs less and I would have liked it more. The queens singing was not the best lol. It's is almost scene for scene when comparing it to the original cartoon Disney snow white movie. I think a lot of people need to rewatch the cartoon version so they can remember how it was. This is a decent live action version of a movie. I like how they kept the campy Disney feel to it. My niece really liked it. They are 11 and 13. The movie was made for kids so that's right on target. It's sad to see so many adults try to ruin something not even made for them. We will watch it again once it's on Disney+.,6/10
